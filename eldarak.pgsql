4	7901dbdf-3b85-4716-a1c4-306415c0362e	en	The revival of Turkmen carpets	<p>Collecting nuances and old craftsmen&rsquo;s secrets by crumbs, we revive Turkmen carpets in accordance with the forgotten ancient technologies. They are the carpets, with the energetics going back into millennia. It does not come to manual skills only, it is a kind of art which requires a great deal of knowledge, efforts, work, intuition, and, the main thing, genetic memory of the people who create our carpets. It is an art at all its stages.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The researcher of Turkmen carpets A. Felkerzam wrote: &ldquo;The one, who happened once to see ancient Turkmen carpets, will never confuse them with articles of other tribes and peoples for the reason of its unique decorative pattern, not even mentioning the technique&rdquo;. The technique of ancient carpet making is described by an arts critic and an expert on history of carpet-making E.G.Tsareva: &ldquo;Apparently, the Turkmens are the only carpets weaving nation, using not only different types of knots: symmetrical, asymmetrical opened to the left and to the right, with depression and without depression, but also special methods of tying&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In our carpets we use technical peculiarities of knots tying methods, characteristic for early Turkmen carpet weaving. Indispensable raw material for manufacturing Turkmen hand-knotted carpets is wool of Sarajin sheep which is bred only in environmental conditions of Turkmenistan and has an extremely limited area of habitat. The Sarajin breed of sheep, created by the Turkmen people, possesses better quality of wool, deprived of dead hair, and owns high content of long down. It has unique flickering flash and silkiness that are distinctive and typical features of Turkmen carpets. For creating our carpets, we select the best wool of spring shearing. Wool is washed manually, exclusively in the hottest summer months, in order to make it aerial and sparkling after drying it in the sun. Then the dry wool is carded with a special comb (darak). While carding the wool is sorted either for warp or for yarn. We use wool of lambs for a weft. Then spinners start working.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Russian ethnographer, who was one of the founders of the Ethnographic museum in St.-Petersburg, Samuil Martynovich Dudin wrote: &ldquo;The yarn was produced with high accuracy to achieve maximum torsion and uniform thickness all over the thread; and, in this respect, Turkmen women reached the results which were almost comparable to mechanized produce&rdquo;. Every spinner, manually, spins no more than 200-250 grams a day, while almost 12 kg are required for a small carpet. Once the threads are spun, the process of dyeing begins; it can be extended for 5-6 months, depending on desirable hue. In old times Turkmen women paid great attention to fermentation of wool which provided penetration of mordant into fibers. The fermentation allows to achieve durable and uniform coloration; it also strengthens the gleaming of a thread.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After rinsing of threads in running water of mountain brooks, threads are dyed. Alum are used as mordant. For vegetable dyeing and fixation of color we use the plants growing in the Karakum sands and the Kopet Dag foothills. It should be said that all the plants we use in dyeing are also medical products. Since threads are prepared, we pick up threads for a carpet warp. We consider the thickness of threads and degree of torsion, providing an indispensable condition that threads for the warp should be spun by one spinner only, for the reason that every spinner is unique by a certain degree of spinning and range of tension. After threads for weaving and for a warp are ready, selection of a thread for the weft begins; and it is a crucial moment. Carpets made of pure wool are subjects to deformation so they need careful handling. S. M. Dudin wrote about the best samples of Turkmen carpets:&ldquo;They were those articles which, in every possible way, were kept, protected, and not put into circulation in daily house use; they were exposed in light just on special important, exceptional occasions (arrival of visitors, holidays, etc.)&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Today, practically, nobody works with a weft made of pure wool; as it is known that the shape of all-wool carpets is not always ideal. In practice, almost all manufacturers use a warp and ducks with addition of chemical fiber or special glue, which is applied to the back side of a carpet to fix its shape. No chemical components are used in our carpets. In hand-knotted carpets, as well as in all articles referring to folk creativity, the aesthetic content of a carpet, its artistic value has special meaning. In a manual carpet-weaving where geometric, rectilinear shapes on the big areas are used, the deflection on symmetry is traced very well; however, it is extremely difficult to achieve complete symmetry of a carpet. To some extent, it is connected with carpet-weaver&rsquo;s experience and handwriting, technique of compacting by the group of women weaving one carpet. Each carpet, even when it has a set of the same decorative patterns, will have the distinctive feature determined by manual skills. Symmetry, approximate to 100 percent, is an advantage which is inherent in machine-made carpets. Therefore, at a choice of hand-knotted fine wool carpets, the artistic content stands in the first place, without paying attention to unobtrusive flaws. Traditions and technology of Turkmen carpet-weaving are characterized by beauty and durability. We create our carpets following the restored ancient technologies and it is a fully ecological process.</p>	Collecting nuances and old craftsmen’s secrets by crumbs, we revive Turkmen carpets in accordance with the forgotten ancient technologies.

Without getting old with time, it acquires new properties - paints become more noble, and its surface gets velvety; that is provided by raw materials for a Turkmen carpet which are exceptionally strong, elastic, all-wool yarn spun from the wool of Sarajin sheep. The sheep of that breed was bred by the method of national selection in the southeastern part of Turkmenistan. The breed received its name from a village of Sary-Dja, located near the town of Mary. It has been bred by long cull of local fat-tail (Pendin) sheep. It was important for sheep breeders that wool of the animals should mostly consist of thin down.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The superior individuals demonstrating the best data on wool productivity were cultivated domestically in the tribe. The basic properties of Sarajin sheep wool are braid-like structure of the fleece, consisting of the soft braids, mainly containing the down (not shorter than 55 mm) and transitive fibers, including insignificant quantity of thin awns. The wool is strong on breakage. A thickness of a fiber is 20-26 micron. The colors are white, light grey, and grey. It contains vegetable impurities (about 1 %) and mineral impurities (about 4 %). The length of the wool is 18-20 cm, besides, the length of a down zone is 9-10 cm.</p>\n<p><img src="http://localhost:8055/assets/3328c283-3ad8-4939-a44d-64b2615abc81" alt="Img 0190" width="1768" height="3024" /></p>\n<p>Sarajin rams and sheep are extremely robust and unpretentious. The climate, in which it was bred, is harsh&ndash; in summer the stem of a thermometer rises above 40 degrees, and in winter bitter cold occurs in Turkmenistan. The breed is well adapted to all-year-round grazing in the conditions of the Karakum desert and the Kopetdag foothills. The wool for the carpet is sheared in the spring when the fibers are longer and stronger. The wool shorn in the spring is not a subject for export. It is a raw material for creating the most beautiful and expensive carpets.</p>	A Turkmen carpet has a surprising merit.

Царева: &laquo;Туркмены являются, по всей видимости, единственным ковродельческим народом, использующим не только разные типы узлов: симметричные, асимметричные открытые влево и вправо, с депрессией и без депрессии, &mdash; но и особые приемы вязки&raquo;. В своих коврах мы используем технические особенности в приемах узловязания, характерные для раннего туркменского ковроделия. Незаменимым сырьем для изготовления туркменских ковров ручной работы является шерсть сараджинской породы овец, которая разводится только в климатических условиях Туркменистана и имеет крайне ограниченный ареал распространения.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Сараджинская порода овец - созданная туркменским народом, обладает лучшим качеством шерсти, лишена мертвого волоса и с большим содержанием длинного пуха. Имеет неповторимый мерцающий блеск и шелковистость, что является отличительной и неповторимой особенностью туркменских ковров. Для создания наших ковров мы отбираем лучшую шерсть весенней стрижки. Промывается шерсть вручную только в самые жаркие летние месяцы для того чтобы при сушке на солнце она стала воздушной и сверкающей. После просушивания ее прочесывают на специальном гребне (дарак). Во время прочесывания идет отбор шерсти для основы и для пряжи. Для утка мы используем шерсть ягнят. Затем за дело берутся прядильщицы. Самуи́л Марты́нович Ду́дин русский этнограф, стоявший у истоков Этнографического музея в Санкт-Петербурге писал: &laquo;Пряжа изготовлялась возможно тщательнее с целью придать ей одинаковую скрученность и толщину на всем протяжении, и в этом отношении туркменками достигались результаты, почти не уступающие машинной выработке&raquo;. Каждая прядильщица, вручную, в день прядет не более 200-250 грамм, когда на небольшой ковер требуется около 12 кг. После получения нитей начинается процесс окрашивания, который может растягиваться до 5-6 месяцев, в зависимости от желаемого цвета. В старину туркменские женщины большое внимание уделяли ферментации шерсти, которая обеспечивала проникновение протравы внутрь волокна. Ферментация позволяет добиваться стойкой и равномерной окраски, также усиливает эффект свечения нити. После полоскания нитей в проточной воде горных ручьев, нити окрашиваются. В качестве протравы использовались квасцы. Для растительного окрашивания и для закрепления окраски мы используем растения, произрастающие в песках Каракумы, и в предгорьях Копетдага. Надо сказать, что все растения, которые мы используем в окрашивании являются и лекарственными средствами. Нити подготовлены, мы подбираем нити для основы ковра. Учитывается толщина нити, степень крутки, при обязательном условии, что нити для основы должны быть спрядены одной прядильщицей, так как у каждой прядильщицы своя определенная степень крутки и степень натяжения. После того, как нити для тканья и для основы готовы, начинается подбор показателей для нити, которая должна стать утком и это очень ответственный момент. Ковры из чистой шерсти подвержены деформации и требуют бережного отношения. С.М. Дудин писал о лучших образцах туркменских ковров: &laquo;Они и были теми изделиями, которые всячески сохраняли, берегли, не пускали в повседневный домашний обиход, а показывали на свет только в особо важных, исключительных случаях (приезд гостей, праздники и т.п.)&raquo;. Сегодня с утком из чистой шерсти практически никто не работает, так как известно, что форма чистошерстяных ковров не всегда идеальна. Практически все производители используют основу для ковра и уток с добавлением химического волокна или специальный клей, который применяется с тыльной стороны ковра для фиксации формы. В наших коврах не используются химические компоненты. В коврах ручной работы, как и во всех изделиях которые относятся к народному творчеству, особое значение имеет эстетическое содержание ковра, его художественная ценность. В ручном ковроткачестве, где используются геометрические, прямолинейные формы на больших площадях, очень хорошо прослеживается отклонение по симметрии и в то же время чрезвычайно сложно добиться полной симметрии ковра. Это некоторым образом связано с опытом и почерком ковровщицы, техникой уплотнения ковра группой женщин ткущих один ковёр. У каждого ковра даже при наборе одних и тех же орнаментов, будет своя отличительная особенность, связанная с ручным трудом. Близкая, к 100 процентам симметрия &ndash; достоинство, которое присуще машинному ковроткачеству. Поэтому при выборе ковров ручной работы из чистой шерсти на первый план выходит художественное содержание, без привлечения внимания на малозаметные погрешности. В традициях и технологии ковроткачества туркмен заложена красота и долговечность. Мы создаем свои ковры по восстановленным технологиям древности и это чисто экологический процесс.</p>	Собирая по крупицам нюансы и секреты старых мастеров, мы возрождаем  туркменские ковры по забытым технологиям древности.

Without getting old with time, it acquires new properties - paints become more noble, and its surface gets velvety; that is provided by raw materials for a Turkmen carpet which are exceptionally strong, elastic, all-wool yarn spun from the wool of Sarajin sheep."}	295

They are the carpets, with the energetics going back into millennia","content":"Collecting nuances and old craftsmen’s secrets by crumbs, we revive Turkmen carpets in accordance with the forgotten ancient technologies. They are the carpets, with the energetics going back into millennia. It does not come to manual skills only,  it is a kind of art which requires a great deal of knowledge, efforts, work, intuition, and, the main thing, genetic memory of the people who create our carpets.\\n \\nIt is an art at all its stages. The researcher of Turkmen carpets A. Felkerzam wrote: “The one, who happened once to see ancient Turkmen carpets, will never confuse them with articles of other tribes and peoples for the reason of its unique decorative pattern, not even mentioning the technique”. The technique of ancient carpet making is described by an arts critic and an expert on history of carpet-making  E.G.Tsareva: “Apparently, the Turkmens are the only carpets weaving nation, using not only different types of knots: symmetrical, asymmetrical opened to the left and to the right, with depression and without depression, but also special methods of tying”. In our carpets we use technical peculiarities of knots tying methods, characteristic for early Turkmen carpet weaving. Indispensable raw material for manufacturing Turkmen hand-knotted carpets is wool of Sarajin sheep which is bred only in environmental conditions of Turkmenistan and has an extremely limited area of habitat. \\n\\nThe Sarajin breed of sheep, created by the Turkmen people, possesses better quality of wool, deprived of dead hair, and owns high content of long down. It has unique flickering flash and silkiness that are distinctive and typical features of Turkmen carpets. For creating our carpets, we select the best wool of spring shearing. Wool is washed manually, exclusively in the hottest summer months, in order to make it aerial and sparkling after drying it in the sun. Then the dry wool is carded with a special comb (darak). While carding the wool is sorted either for warp or for yarn. We use wool of lambs for a weft. Then spinners start working.\\n\\nThe Russian ethnographer, who was one of the founders of the Ethnographic museum in St.-Petersburg,  Samuil Martynovich Dudin wrote: “The yarn was produced with high accuracy to achieve maximum torsion and uniform thickness all over the thread; and, in this respect, Turkmen women reached the results which were almost comparable to mechanized produce”. Every spinner, manually, spins no more than 200-250 grams a day, while almost 12 kg are required for a small carpet.\\nOnce the threads are spun, the process of dyeing begins; it can be extended for 5-6 months, depending on desirable hue. \\n\\nIn old times Turkmen women paid great attention to fermentation of wool which provided penetration of mordant into fibers. The fermentation allows to achieve durable and uniform coloration; it also strengthens the gleaming of a thread. After rinsing of threads in running water of mountain brooks, threads are dyed. Alum are used as mordant. For vegetable dyeing and fixation of color we use the plants growing in the Karakum sands and the Kopet Dag foothills. It should be said that all the plants we use in dyeing are also medical products.\\n\\nSince threads are prepared, we pick up threads for a carpet warp. We consider the thickness of threads and degree of torsion, providing an indispensable condition that threads for the warp should be spun by one spinner only, for the reason that every spinner is unique by a certain degree of spinning and range of tension. After threads for weaving and for a warp are ready, selection of a thread for the weft begins; and it is a crucial moment. \\n\\nCarpets made of pure wool are subjects to deformation so they need careful handling. S. M. Dudin wrote about the best samples of Turkmen carpets:“They were those articles which, in every possible way, were kept, protected, and not put into circulation in daily house use; they were exposed in light just on special important, exceptional occasions (arrival of visitors, holidays, etc.)”. \\nToday, practically, nobody works with a weft made of pure wool; as it is known that the shape of all-wool carpets is not always ideal. In practice, almost all manufacturers use a warp and ducks with addition of chemical fiber or special glue, which is applied to the back side of a carpet to fix its shape. No chemical components are used in our carpets.\\n\\nIn hand-knotted carpets, as well as in all articles referring to folk creativity, the aesthetic content of a carpet, its artistic value has special meaning. In a manual carpet-weaving where geometric, rectilinear shapes on the big areas are used, the deflection on symmetry is traced very well; however, it is extremely difficult to achieve complete symmetry of a carpet. To some extent, it is connected with carpet-weaver’s experience and handwriting, technique of compacting by the group of women weaving one carpet. Each carpet, even when it has a set of the same decorative patterns, will have the distinctive feature determined by manual skills. Symmetry, approximate to 100 percent, is an advantage which is inherent in machine-made carpets. Therefore, at a choice of hand-knotted fine wool carpets, the artistic content stands in the first place, without paying attention to unobtrusive flaws. Traditions and technology of Turkmen carpet-weaving are characterized by beauty and durability. We create our carpets following the restored ancient technologies and it is a fully ecological process."},{"languages_code":"ru","title":"Возрождение  туркменских ковров","description":"Собирая по крупицам нюансы и секреты старых мастеров, мы возрождаем  туркменские ковры по забытым технологиям древности. Ковры, энергетика которых уходит вглубь тысячелетий","content":"Собирая по крупицам нюансы и секреты старых мастеров, мы возрождаем  туркменские ковры по забытым технологиям древности. Ковры, энергетика которых уходит вглубь тысячелетий. Это не просто ручной труд,  это -  искусство, которое требует  больших знаний, усилий, труда, интуиции,  а главное генетической памяти  людей, которые создают наши ковры. Это -  искусство на всех этапах создания.  Исследователь туркменских ковров,  А.Фелькерзам писал: «Кому хоть раз пришлось видеть старинные туркменские ковры, тот никогда не спутает их с изделиями других племен и народов уже по одному орнаменту, не говоря о технике». О технике исполнения старинных туркменских  ковров пишет искусствовед, специалист по истории ковроделия   Е.Г. Царева: «Туркмены являются, по всей видимости, единственным ковродельческим народом, использующим не только разные типы узлов: симметричные, асимметричные открытые влево и вправо, с депрессией и без депрессии, — но и особые приемы вязки». В своих коврах мы используем технические особенности в приемах узловязания, характерные для раннего туркменского ковроделия. Незаменимым сырьем для изготовления туркменских ковров ручной работы  является шерсть сараджинской породы овец, которая разводится только в климатических условиях Туркменистана и имеет крайне ограниченный ареал распространения. Сараджинская порода овец - созданная туркменским народом, обладает лучшим качеством шерсти, лишена мертвого волоса и с большим содержанием длинного пуха.  Имеет неповторимый мерцающий блеск и шелковистость,  что является отличительной и неповторимой особенностью туркменских ковров.  Для создания наших ковров мы отбираем лучшую шерсть весенней стрижки. Промывается шерсть вручную только в самые жаркие летние месяцы для того чтобы при сушке на солнце она стала воздушной и сверкающей. После просушивания ее прочесывают на специальном гребне (дарак). Во время прочесывания идет отбор шерсти для основы и для пряжи. Для утка мы используем шерсть ягнят. Затем за дело берутся прядильщицы. Самуи́л Марты́нович Ду́дин русский этнограф, стоявший у истоков Этнографического музея в Санкт-Петербурге писал:  «Пряжа изготовлялась возможно тщательнее с целью придать ей одинаковую скрученность и толщину на всем протяжении, и в этом отношении туркменками достигались результаты, почти не уступающие машинной выработке». Каждая прядильщица,  вручную, в день прядет не более 200-250 грамм, когда на небольшой ковер требуется около 12 кг.  После получения нитей начинается процесс окрашивания, который может растягиваться  до 5-6 месяцев, в зависимости от желаемого цвета. В старину туркменские женщины большое внимание уделяли ферментации шерсти, которая обеспечивала проникновение протравы внутрь волокна. Ферментация позволяет  добиваться стойкой и равномерной окраски, также усиливает  эффект свечения нити. После полоскания нитей в проточной воде горных ручьев, нити окрашиваются. В качестве протравы использовались квасцы.  Для растительного окрашивания и для закрепления окраски мы используем растения,  произрастающие в песках Каракумы, и в предгорьях Копетдага. Надо сказать, что все растения,  которые мы используем в окрашивании являются и лекарственными средствами.  Нити подготовлены, мы подбираем нити для основы ковра. Учитывается толщина нити, степень крутки, при обязательном условии,  что нити для основы должны быть спрядены одной прядильщицей, так как у каждой прядильщицы своя определенная степень крутки и степень натяжения. После того, как нити для тканья и для основы готовы, начинается подбор показателей для нити, которая должна стать утком и это очень ответственный момент. Ковры из чистой шерсти подвержены деформации и требуют бережного отношения.  С.М. Дудин писал о лучших образцах туркменских ковров: «Они и были теми изделиями, которые всячески сохраняли, берегли, не пускали в повседневный домашний обиход, а показывали на свет только в особо важных, исключительных случаях (приезд гостей, праздники и т.п.)».   Сегодня с утком из чистой шерсти практически никто не работает, так как  известно, что форма чистошерстяных ковров не всегда идеальна. Практически все производители  используют  основу для ковра и уток с добавлением химического волокна или специальный клей,   который применяется  с тыльной стороны ковра для фиксации формы.  В наших коврах не используются химические компоненты.\\n\\nВ коврах ручной работы, как и во всех изделиях которые относятся к народному творчеству, особое значение имеет эстетическое содержание ковра, его художественная ценность.  В ручном  ковроткачестве, где используются геометрические, прямолинейные формы на больших площадях, очень хорошо прослеживается отклонение по симметрии и в то же время чрезвычайно сложно добиться полной симметрии ковра. Это некоторым образом связано с опытом и почерком ковровщицы, техникой уплотнения ковра группой женщин ткущих один ковёр. У каждого ковра даже при наборе одних и тех же орнаментов, будет своя отличительная особенность, связанная с ручным трудом. Близкая,  к 100 процентам симметрия – достоинство,  которое присуще машинному ковроткачеству. Поэтому при выборе ковров ручной работы из чистой шерсти   на первый план выходит художественное содержание, без привлечения внимания на малозаметные погрешности.\\nВ традициях и технологии ковроткачества туркмен заложена красота и долговечность.\\nМы создаем свои ковры по восстановленным технологиям древности и это чисто экологический процесс."},{"languages_code":"tm","title":"Türkmen halysyny gadymy tehnologiýa boýunça dikeldýäris","description":"Irki döwrüň  ussatlarynyň syrlaryny we kiçijigem bolsa özboluşly tärini toplamak bilen, biz türkmen halysyny gadymy tehnologiýa boýunça dikeldýäris.

It does not come to manual skills only,  it is a kind of art which requires a great deal of knowledge, efforts, work, intuition, and, the main thing, genetic memory of the people who create our carpets.\\n \\nIt is an art at all its stages. The researcher of Turkmen carpets A.

The technique of ancient carpet making is described by an arts critic and an expert on history of carpet-making  E.G.Tsareva: “Apparently, the Turkmens are the only carpets weaving nation, using not only different types of knots: symmetrical, asymmetrical opened to the left and to the right, with depression and without depression, but also special methods of tying”. In our carpets we use technical peculiarities of knots tying methods, characteristic for early Turkmen carpet weaving. Indispensable raw material for manufacturing Turkmen hand-knotted carpets is wool of Sarajin sheep which is bred only in environmental conditions of Turkmenistan and has an extremely limited area of habitat. \\n\\nThe Sarajin breed of sheep, created by the Turkmen people, possesses better quality of wool, deprived of dead hair, and owns high content of long down. It has unique flickering flash and silkiness that are distinctive and typical features of Turkmen carpets. For creating our carpets, we select the best wool of spring shearing. Wool is washed manually, exclusively in the hottest summer months, in order to make it aerial and sparkling after drying it in the sun. Then the dry wool is carded with a special comb (darak). While carding the wool is sorted either for warp or for yarn. We use wool of lambs for a weft. Then spinners start working.\\n\\nThe Russian ethnographer, who was one of the founders of the Ethnographic museum in St.-Petersburg,  Samuil Martynovich Dudin wrote: “The yarn was produced with high accuracy to achieve maximum torsion and uniform thickness all over the thread; and, in this respect, Turkmen women reached the results which were almost comparable to mechanized produce”. Every spinner, manually, spins no more than 200-250 grams a day, while almost 12 kg are required for a small carpet.\\nOnce the threads are spun, the process of dyeing begins; it can be extended for 5-6 months, depending on desirable hue. \\n\\nIn old times Turkmen women paid great attention to fermentation of wool which provided penetration of mordant into fibers. The fermentation allows to achieve durable and uniform coloration; it also strengthens the gleaming of a thread. After rinsing of threads in running water of mountain brooks, threads are dyed. Alum are used as mordant. For vegetable dyeing and fixation of color we use the plants growing in the Karakum sands and the Kopet Dag foothills. It should be said that all the plants we use in dyeing are also medical products.\\n\\nSince threads are prepared, we pick up threads for a carpet warp. We consider the thickness of threads and degree of torsion, providing an indispensable condition that threads for the warp should be spun by one spinner only, for the reason that every spinner is unique by a certain degree of spinning and range of tension. After threads for weaving and for a warp are ready, selection of a thread for the weft begins; and it is a crucial moment. \\n\\nCarpets made of pure wool are subjects to deformation so they need careful handling. S. M. Dudin wrote about the best samples of Turkmen carpets:“They were those articles which, in every possible way, were kept, protected, and not put into circulation in daily house use; they were exposed in light just on special important, exceptional occasions (arrival of visitors, holidays, etc.)”. \\nToday, practically, nobody works with a weft made of pure wool; as it is known that the shape of all-wool carpets is not always ideal. In practice, almost all manufacturers use a warp and ducks with addition of chemical fiber or special glue, which is applied to the back side of a carpet to fix its shape. No chemical components are used in our carpets.\\n\\nIn hand-knotted carpets, as well as in all articles referring to folk creativity, the aesthetic content of a carpet, its artistic value has special meaning. In a manual carpet-weaving where geometric, rectilinear shapes on the big areas are used, the deflection on symmetry is traced very well; however, it is extremely difficult to achieve complete symmetry of a carpet. To some extent, it is connected with carpet-weaver’s experience and handwriting, technique of compacting by the group of women weaving one carpet. Each carpet, even when it has a set of the same decorative patterns, will have the distinctive feature determined by manual skills. Symmetry, approximate to 100 percent, is an advantage which is inherent in machine-made carpets. Therefore, at a choice of hand-knotted fine wool carpets, the artistic content stands in the first place, without paying attention to unobtrusive flaws. Traditions and technology of Turkmen carpet-weaving are characterized by beauty and durability. We create our carpets following the restored ancient technologies and it is a fully ecological process."},{"languages_code":"ru","title":"Возрождение  туркменских ковров","description":"Собирая по крупицам нюансы и секреты старых мастеров, мы возрождаем  туркменские ковры по забытым технологиям древности. Ковры, энергетика которых уходит вглубь тысячелетий","content":"Собирая по крупицам нюансы и секреты старых мастеров, мы возрождаем  туркменские ковры по забытым технологиям древности. Ковры, энергетика которых уходит вглубь тысячелетий. Это не просто ручной труд,  это -  искусство, которое требует  больших знаний, усилий, труда, интуиции,  а главное генетической памяти  людей, которые создают наши ковры. Это -  искусство на всех этапах создания.  Исследователь туркменских ковров,  А.Фелькерзам писал: «Кому хоть раз пришлось видеть старинные туркменские ковры, тот никогда не спутает их с изделиями других племен и народов уже по одному орнаменту, не говоря о технике». О технике исполнения старинных туркменских  ковров пишет искусствовед, специалист по истории ковроделия   Е.Г. Царева: «Туркмены являются, по всей видимости, единственным ковродельческим народом, использующим не только разные типы узлов: симметричные, асимметричные открытые влево и вправо, с депрессией и без депрессии, — но и особые приемы вязки». В своих коврах мы используем технические особенности в приемах узловязания, характерные для раннего туркменского ковроделия. Незаменимым сырьем для изготовления туркменских ковров ручной работы  является шерсть сараджинской породы овец, которая разводится только в климатических условиях Туркменистана и имеет крайне ограниченный ареал распространения. Сараджинская порода овец - созданная туркменским народом, обладает лучшим качеством шерсти, лишена мертвого волоса и с большим содержанием длинного пуха.  Имеет неповторимый мерцающий блеск и шелковистость,  что является отличительной и неповторимой особенностью туркменских ковров.  Для создания наших ковров мы отбираем лучшую шерсть весенней стрижки. Промывается шерсть вручную только в самые жаркие летние месяцы для того чтобы при сушке на солнце она стала воздушной и сверкающей. После просушивания ее прочесывают на специальном гребне (дарак). Во время прочесывания идет отбор шерсти для основы и для пряжи. Для утка мы используем шерсть ягнят. Затем за дело берутся прядильщицы. Самуи́л Марты́нович Ду́дин русский этнограф, стоявший у истоков Этнографического музея в Санкт-Петербурге писал:  «Пряжа изготовлялась возможно тщательнее с целью придать ей одинаковую скрученность и толщину на всем протяжении, и в этом отношении туркменками достигались результаты, почти не уступающие машинной выработке». Каждая прядильщица,  вручную, в день прядет не более 200-250 грамм, когда на небольшой ковер требуется около 12 кг.  После получения нитей начинается процесс окрашивания, который может растягиваться  до 5-6 месяцев, в зависимости от желаемого цвета. В старину туркменские женщины большое внимание уделяли ферментации шерсти, которая обеспечивала проникновение протравы внутрь волокна. Ферментация позволяет  добиваться стойкой и равномерной окраски, также усиливает  эффект свечения нити. После полоскания нитей в проточной воде горных ручьев, нити окрашиваются. В качестве протравы использовались квасцы.  Для растительного окрашивания и для закрепления окраски мы используем растения,  произрастающие в песках Каракумы, и в предгорьях Копетдага. Надо сказать, что все растения,  которые мы используем в окрашивании являются и лекарственными средствами.  Нити подготовлены, мы подбираем нити для основы ковра. Учитывается толщина нити, степень крутки, при обязательном условии,  что нити для основы должны быть спрядены одной прядильщицей, так как у каждой прядильщицы своя определенная степень крутки и степень натяжения. После того, как нити для тканья и для основы готовы, начинается подбор показателей для нити, которая должна стать утком и это очень ответственный момент. Ковры из чистой шерсти подвержены деформации и требуют бережного отношения.  С.М. Дудин писал о лучших образцах туркменских ковров: «Они и были теми изделиями, которые всячески сохраняли, берегли, не пускали в повседневный домашний обиход, а показывали на свет только в особо важных, исключительных случаях (приезд гостей, праздники и т.п.)».   Сегодня с утком из чистой шерсти практически никто не работает, так как  известно, что форма чистошерстяных ковров не всегда идеальна. Практически все производители  используют  основу для ковра и уток с добавлением химического волокна или специальный клей,   который применяется  с тыльной стороны ковра для фиксации формы.  В наших коврах не используются химические компоненты.\\n\\nВ коврах ручной работы, как и во всех изделиях которые относятся к народному творчеству, особое значение имеет эстетическое содержание ковра, его художественная ценность.  В ручном  ковроткачестве, где используются геометрические, прямолинейные формы на больших площадях, очень хорошо прослеживается отклонение по симметрии и в то же время чрезвычайно сложно добиться полной симметрии ковра. Это некоторым образом связано с опытом и почерком ковровщицы, техникой уплотнения ковра группой женщин ткущих один ковёр. У каждого ковра даже при наборе одних и тех же орнаментов, будет своя отличительная особенность, связанная с ручным трудом. Близкая,  к 100 процентам симметрия – достоинство,  которое присуще машинному ковроткачеству. Поэтому при выборе ковров ручной работы из чистой шерсти   на первый план выходит художественное содержание, без привлечения внимания на малозаметные погрешности.\\nВ традициях и технологии ковроткачества туркмен заложена красота и долговечность.\\nМы создаем свои ковры по восстановленным технологиям древности и это чисто экологический процесс."},{"languages_code":"tm","title":"Türkmen halysyny gadymy tehnologiýa boýunça dikeldýäris","description":"Irki döwrüň  ussatlarynyň syrlaryny we kiçijigem bolsa özboluşly tärini toplamak bilen, biz türkmen halysyny gadymy tehnologiýa boýunça dikeldýäris.

We consider the thickness of threads and degree of torsion, providing an indispensable condition that threads for the warp should be spun by one spinner only, for the reason that every spinner is unique by a certain degree of spinning and range of tension. After threads for weaving and for a warp are ready, selection of a thread for the weft begins; and it is a crucial moment. \\n\\nCarpets made of pure wool are subjects to deformation so they need careful handling. S. M. Dudin wrote about the best samples of Turkmen carpets:“They were those articles which, in every possible way, were kept, protected, and not put into circulation in daily house use; they were exposed in light just on special important, exceptional occasions (arrival of visitors, holidays, etc.)”. \\nToday, practically, nobody works with a weft made of pure wool; as it is known that the shape of all-wool carpets is not always ideal. In practice, almost all manufacturers use a warp and ducks with addition of chemical fiber or special glue, which is applied to the back side of a carpet to fix its shape. No chemical components are used in our carpets.\\n\\nIn hand-knotted carpets, as well as in all articles referring to folk creativity, the aesthetic content of a carpet, its artistic value has special meaning. In a manual carpet-weaving where geometric, rectilinear shapes on the big areas are used, the deflection on symmetry is traced very well; however, it is extremely difficult to achieve complete symmetry of a carpet. To some extent, it is connected with carpet-weaver’s experience and handwriting, technique of compacting by the group of women weaving one carpet. Each carpet, even when it has a set of the same decorative patterns, will have the distinctive feature determined by manual skills. Symmetry, approximate to 100 percent, is an advantage which is inherent in machine-made carpets. Therefore, at a choice of hand-knotted fine wool carpets, the artistic content stands in the first place, without paying attention to unobtrusive flaws. Traditions and technology of Turkmen carpet-weaving are characterized by beauty and durability. We create our carpets following the restored ancient technologies and it is a fully ecological process.","articles_id":"7901dbdf-3b85-4716-a1c4-306415c0362e"}	306

Ковры, энергетика которых уходит вглубь тысячелетий. Это не просто ручной труд,  это -  искусство, которое требует  больших знаний, усилий, труда, интуиции,  а главное генетической памяти  людей, которые создают наши ковры. Это -  искусство на всех этапах создания.  Исследователь туркменских ковров,  А.Фелькерзам писал: «Кому хоть раз пришлось видеть старинные туркменские ковры, тот никогда не спутает их с изделиями других племен и народов уже по одному орнаменту, не говоря о технике». О технике исполнения старинных туркменских  ковров пишет искусствовед, специалист по истории ковроделия   Е.Г. Царева: «Туркмены являются, по всей видимости, единственным ковродельческим народом, использующим не только разные типы узлов: симметричные, асимметричные открытые влево и вправо, с депрессией и без депрессии, — но и особые приемы вязки». В своих коврах мы используем технические особенности в приемах узловязания, характерные для раннего туркменского ковроделия. Незаменимым сырьем для изготовления туркменских ковров ручной работы  является шерсть сараджинской породы овец, которая разводится только в климатических условиях Туркменистана и имеет крайне ограниченный ареал распространения. Сараджинская порода овец - созданная туркменским народом, обладает лучшим качеством шерсти, лишена мертвого волоса и с большим содержанием длинного пуха.  Имеет неповторимый мерцающий блеск и шелковистость,  что является отличительной и неповторимой особенностью туркменских ковров.  Для создания наших ковров мы отбираем лучшую шерсть весенней стрижки. Промывается шерсть вручную только в самые жаркие летние месяцы для того чтобы при сушке на солнце она стала воздушной и сверкающей. После просушивания ее прочесывают на специальном гребне (дарак). Во время прочесывания идет отбор шерсти для основы и для пряжи. Для утка мы используем шерсть ягнят. Затем за дело берутся прядильщицы. Самуи́л Марты́нович Ду́дин русский этнограф, стоявший у истоков Этнографического музея в Санкт-Петербурге писал:  «Пряжа изготовлялась возможно тщательнее с целью придать ей одинаковую скрученность и толщину на всем протяжении, и в этом отношении туркменками достигались результаты, почти не уступающие машинной выработке». Каждая прядильщица,  вручную, в день прядет не более 200-250 грамм, когда на небольшой ковер требуется около 12 кг.  После получения нитей начинается процесс окрашивания, который может растягиваться  до 5-6 месяцев, в зависимости от желаемого цвета. В старину туркменские женщины большое внимание уделяли ферментации шерсти, которая обеспечивала проникновение протравы внутрь волокна. Ферментация позволяет  добиваться стойкой и равномерной окраски, также усиливает  эффект свечения нити. После полоскания нитей в проточной воде горных ручьев, нити окрашиваются. В качестве протравы использовались квасцы.  Для растительного окрашивания и для закрепления окраски мы используем растения,  произрастающие в песках Каракумы, и в предгорьях Копетдага. Надо сказать, что все растения,  которые мы используем в окрашивании являются и лекарственными средствами.  Нити подготовлены, мы подбираем нити для основы ковра. Учитывается толщина нити, степень крутки, при обязательном условии,  что нити для основы должны быть спрядены одной прядильщицей, так как у каждой прядильщицы своя определенная степень крутки и степень натяжения. После того, как нити для тканья и для основы готовы, начинается подбор показателей для нити, которая должна стать утком и это очень ответственный момент. Ковры из чистой шерсти подвержены деформации и требуют бережного отношения.  С.М. Дудин писал о лучших образцах туркменских ковров: «Они и были теми изделиями, которые всячески сохраняли, берегли, не пускали в повседневный домашний обиход, а показывали на свет только в особо важных, исключительных случаях (приезд гостей, праздники и т.п.)».   Сегодня с утком из чистой шерсти практически никто не работает, так как  известно, что форма чистошерстяных ковров не всегда идеальна. Практически все производители  используют  основу для ковра и уток с добавлением химического волокна или специальный клей,   который применяется  с тыльной стороны ковра для фиксации формы.  В наших коврах не используются химические компоненты.\\n\\nВ коврах ручной работы, как и во всех изделиях которые относятся к народному творчеству, особое значение имеет эстетическое содержание ковра, его художественная ценность.  В ручном  ковроткачестве, где используются геометрические, прямолинейные формы на больших площадях, очень хорошо прослеживается отклонение по симметрии и в то же время чрезвычайно сложно добиться полной симметрии ковра. Это некоторым образом связано с опытом и почерком ковровщицы, техникой уплотнения ковра группой женщин ткущих один ковёр. У каждого ковра даже при наборе одних и тех же орнаментов, будет своя отличительная особенность, связанная с ручным трудом. Близкая,  к 100 процентам симметрия – достоинство,  которое присуще машинному ковроткачеству. Поэтому при выборе ковров ручной работы из чистой шерсти   на первый план выходит художественное содержание, без привлечения внимания на малозаметные погрешности.\\nВ традициях и технологии ковроткачества туркмен заложена красота и долговечность.\\nМы создаем свои ковры по восстановленным технологиям древности и это чисто экологический процесс.","articles_id":"7901dbdf-3b85-4716-a1c4-306415c0362e"}	{"languages_code":"ru","title":"Возрождение  туркменских ковров","description":"Собирая по крупицам нюансы и секреты старых мастеров, мы возрождаем  туркменские ковры по забытым технологиям древности.

They are the carpets, with the energetics going back into millennia. It does not come to manual skills only,&nbsp; it is a kind of art which requires a great deal of knowledge, efforts, work, intuition, and, the main thing, genetic memory of the people who create our carpets.</p>\\n<p>It is an art at all its stages. The researcher of Turkmen carpets A. Felkerzam wrote: &ldquo;The one, who happened once to see ancient Turkmen carpets, will never confuse them with articles of other tribes and peoples for the reason of its unique decorative pattern, not even mentioning the technique&rdquo;. The technique of ancient carpet making is described by an arts critic and an expert on history of carpet-making&nbsp; E.G.Tsareva: &ldquo;Apparently, the Turkmens are the only carpets weaving nation, using not only different types of knots: symmetrical, asymmetrical opened to the left and to the right, with depression and without depression, but also special methods of tying&rdquo;. In our carpets we use technical peculiarities of knots tying methods, characteristic for early Turkmen carpet weaving. Indispensable raw material for manufacturing Turkmen hand-knotted carpets is wool of Sarajin sheep which is bred only in environmental conditions of Turkmenistan and has an extremely limited area of habitat.</p>\\n<p>The Sarajin breed of sheep, created by the Turkmen people, possesses better quality of wool, deprived of dead hair, and owns high content of long down. It has unique flickering flash and silkiness that are distinctive and typical features of Turkmen carpets. For creating our carpets, we select the best wool of spring shearing. Wool is washed manually, exclusively in the hottest summer months, in order to make it aerial and sparkling after drying it in the sun. Then the dry wool is carded with a special comb (<em>darak</em>). While carding the wool is sorted either for warp or for yarn. We use wool of lambs for a weft. Then spinners start working.</p>\\n<p>The Russian ethnographer, who was one of the founders of the Ethnographic museum in St.-Petersburg,&nbsp; Samuil Martynovich Dudin wrote: &ldquo;The yarn was produced with high accuracy to achieve maximum torsion and uniform thickness all over the thread; and, in this respect, Turkmen women reached the results which were almost comparable to mechanized produce&rdquo;. Every spinner, manually, spins no more than 200-250 grams a day, while almost 12 kg are required for a small carpet.</p>\\n<p>Once the threads are spun, the process of dyeing begins; it can be extended for 5-6 months, depending on desirable hue.</p>\\n<p>In old times Turkmen women paid great attention to fermentation of wool which provided penetration of mordant into fibers. The fermentation allows to achieve durable and uniform coloration; it also strengthens the gleaming of a thread. After rinsing of threads in running water of mountain brooks, threads are dyed. Alum are used as mordant. For vegetable dyeing and fixation of color we use the plants growing in the Karakum sands and the Kopet Dag foothills. It should be said that all the plants we use in dyeing are also medical products.</p>\\n<p>Since threads are prepared, we pick up threads for a carpet warp. We consider the thickness of threads and degree of torsion, providing an indispensable condition that threads for the warp should be spun by one spinner only, for the reason that every spinner is unique by a certain degree of spinning and range of tension. After threads for weaving and for a warp are ready, selection of a thread for the weft begins; and it is a crucial moment.</p>\\n<p>Carpets made of pure wool are subjects to deformation so they need careful handling. S. M. Dudin wrote about the best samples of Turkmen carpets:&ldquo;They were those articles which, in every possible way, were kept, protected, and not put into circulation in daily house use; they were exposed in light just on special important, exceptional occasions (arrival of visitors, holidays, etc.)&rdquo;.</p>\\n<p>Today, practically, nobody works with a weft made of pure wool; as it is known that the shape of all-wool carpets is not always ideal. In practice, almost all manufacturers use a warp and ducks with addition of chemical fiber or special glue, which is applied to the back side of a carpet to fix its shape. No chemical components are used in our carpets.</p>\\n<p>In hand-knotted carpets, as well as in all articles referring to folk creativity, the aesthetic content of a carpet, its artistic value has special meaning. In a manual carpet-weaving where geometric, rectilinear shapes on the big areas are used, the deflection on symmetry is traced very well; however, it is extremely difficult to achieve complete symmetry of a carpet. To some extent, it is connected with carpet-weaver&rsquo;s experience and handwriting, technique of compacting by the group of women weaving one carpet. Each carpet, even when it has a set of the same decorative patterns, will have the distinctive feature determined by manual skills. Symmetry, approximate to 100 percent, is an advantage which is inherent in machine-made carpets. Therefore, at a choice of hand-knotted fine wool carpets, the artistic content stands in the first place, without paying attention to unobtrusive flaws. Traditions and technology of Turkmen carpet-weaving are characterized by beauty and durability. We create our carpets following the restored ancient technologies and it is a fully ecological process.</p>"},{"languages_code":"ru","title":"Возраждение","description":"Собирая по крупицам нюансы и секреты старых мастеров, мы возрождаем  туркменские ковры по забытым технологиям древности","content":"<p>Собирая по крупицам нюансы и секреты старых мастеров, мы возрождаем&nbsp; туркменские ковры по забытым технологиям древности. Ковры, энергетика которых уходит вглубь тысячелетий. Это не просто ручной труд,&nbsp; это -&nbsp; искусство, которое требует&nbsp; больших знаний, усилий, труда, интуиции,&nbsp; а главное генетической памяти&nbsp; людей, которые создают наши ковры.</p>\\n<p>Это -&nbsp; искусство на всех этапах создания.&nbsp; Исследователь туркменских ковров, &nbsp;А.Фелькерзам&nbsp;писал: &laquo;Кому хоть раз пришлось видеть старинные&nbsp;туркменские&nbsp;ковры, тот никогда&nbsp;не&nbsp;спутает&nbsp;их с изделиями&nbsp;других&nbsp;племен&nbsp;и народов уже по одному орнаменту, не говоря о технике&raquo;. О технике исполнения старинных туркменских&nbsp; ковров пишет искусствовед, специалист по истории ковроделия&nbsp;&nbsp; Е.Г. Царева: &laquo;Туркмены являются, по всей видимости, единственным ковродельческим народом, использующим не только разные типы узлов: симметричные, асимметричные открытые влево и вправо, с депрессией и без депрессии, &mdash; но и особые приемы вязки&raquo;. В своих коврах мы используем технические особенности в приемах узловязания, характерные для раннего туркменского ковроделия. Незаменимым сырьем для изготовления туркменских ковров ручной работы&nbsp; является шерсть сараджинской породы овец, которая разводится только в климатических условиях Туркменистана и имеет крайне ограниченный ареал распространения.</p>\\n<p>Сараджинская порода овец - созданная туркменским народом, обладает лучшим качеством шерсти, лишена мертвого волоса и с большим содержанием длинного пуха.&nbsp; Имеет неповторимый мерцающий блеск и шелковистость,&nbsp; что является отличительной и неповторимой особенностью туркменских ковров.&nbsp; Для создания наших ковров мы отбираем лучшую шерсть весенней стрижки. Промывается шерсть вручную только в самые жаркие летние месяцы для того чтобы при сушке на солнце она стала воздушной и сверкающей. После просушивания ее прочесывают на специальном гребне (дарак). Во время прочесывания идет отбор шерсти для основы и для пряжи. Для утка мы используем шерсть ягнят. Затем за дело берутся прядильщицы. Самуи́л Марты́нович&nbsp;<strong>Ду́дин</strong> русский этнограф, стоявший у истоков Этнографического музея в Санкт-Петербурге писал: &nbsp;&laquo;Пряжа изготовлялась возможно тщательнее с целью придать ей одинаковую скрученность и толщину на всем протяжении, и в этом отношении туркменками достигались результаты, почти не уступающие машинной выработке&raquo;. Каждая прядильщица,&nbsp; вручную, в день прядет не более 200-250 грамм, когда на небольшой ковер требуется около 12 кг.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>После получения нитей начинается процесс окрашивания, который может растягиваться&nbsp; до 5-6 месяцев, в зависимости от желаемого цвета.</p>\\n<p>В старину туркменские женщины большое внимание уделяли ферментации шерсти, которая обеспечивала проникновение протравы внутрь волокна. Ферментация позволяет&nbsp; добиваться стойкой и равномерной окраски, также усиливает&nbsp; эффект свечения нити. После полоскания нитей в проточной воде горных ручьев, нити окрашиваются. В качестве протравы использовались квасцы.&nbsp; Для растительного окрашивания и для закрепления окраски мы используем растения,&nbsp; произрастающие в песках Каракумы, и в предгорьях Копетдага.<strong> </strong>Надо сказать, что все растения,&nbsp; которые мы используем в окрашивании являются и лекарственными средствами.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Нити подготовлены, мы подбираем нити для основы ковра. Учитывается толщина нити, степень крутки, при обязательном условии,&nbsp; что нити для основы должны быть спрядены одной прядильщицей, так как у каждой прядильщицы своя определенная степень крутки и степень натяжения. После того, как нити для тканья и для основы готовы, начинается подбор показателей для нити, которая должна стать утком и это очень ответственный момент. Ковры из чистой шерсти подвержены деформации и требуют бережного отношения.&nbsp; С.М. Дудин писал о лучших образцах туркменских ковров: &laquo;Они и были теми изделиями, которые всячески сохраняли, берегли, не пускали в повседневный домашний обиход, а показывали на свет только в особо важных, исключительных случаях (приезд гостей, праздники и т.п.)&raquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Сегодня с утком из чистой шерсти практически никто не работает, так как&nbsp; известно, что форма чистошерстяных ковров не всегда идеальна. Практически все производители&nbsp; используют&nbsp; основу для ковра и уток с добавлением химического волокна или специальный клей,&nbsp;&nbsp; который применяется&nbsp; с тыльной стороны ковра для фиксации формы.&nbsp; В наших коврах не используются химические компоненты.</p>\\n<p>В коврах ручной работы, как и во всех изделиях которые относятся к народному творчеству, особое значение имеет эстетическое содержание ковра, его художественная ценность.&nbsp; В ручном&nbsp; ковроткачестве, где используются геометрические, прямолинейные формы на больших площадях, очень хорошо прослеживается отклонение по симметрии и в то же время чрезвычайно сложно добиться полной симметрии ковра. Это некоторым образом связано с опытом и почерком ковровщицы, техникой уплотнения ковра группой женщин ткущих один ковёр. У каждого ковра даже при наборе одних и тех же орнаментов, будет своя отличительная особенность, связанная с ручным трудом. Близкая,&nbsp; к 100 процентам симметрия &ndash; достоинство,&nbsp; которое присуще машинному ковроткачеству. Поэтому при выборе ковров ручной работы из чистой шерсти &nbsp;&nbsp;на первый план выходит художественное содержание, без привлечения внимания на малозаметные погрешности.</p>\\n<p>В традициях и технологии ковроткачества туркмен заложена красота и долговечность.</p>\\n<p>Мы создаем свои ковры по восстановленным технологиям древности и это чисто экологический процесс.&nbsp;</p>"},{"languages_code":"tm","title":"Dikeldiş","description":"Irki döwrüň  ussatlarynyň syrlaryny we kiçijigem bolsa özboluşly tärini toplamak bilen, biz türkmen halysyny gadymy tehnologiýa boýunça dikeldýäris","content":"<p>Irki d&ouml;wr&uuml;ň&nbsp; ussatlarynyň syrlaryny we ki&ccedil;ijigem bolsa &ouml;zboluşly t&auml;rini toplamak bilen, biz t&uuml;rkmen halysyny gadymy tehnologi&yacute;a bo&yacute;un&ccedil;a dikeld&yacute;&auml;ris.

Ковры, энергетика которых уходит вглубь тысячелетий. Это не просто ручной труд,&nbsp; это -&nbsp; искусство, которое требует&nbsp; больших знаний, усилий, труда, интуиции,&nbsp; а главное генетической памяти&nbsp; людей, которые создают наши ковры.</p>\\n<p>Это -&nbsp; искусство на всех этапах создания.&nbsp; Исследователь туркменских ковров, &nbsp;А.Фелькерзам&nbsp;писал: &laquo;Кому хоть раз пришлось видеть старинные&nbsp;туркменские&nbsp;ковры, тот никогда&nbsp;не&nbsp;спутает&nbsp;их с изделиями&nbsp;других&nbsp;племен&nbsp;и народов уже по одному орнаменту, не говоря о технике&raquo;. О технике исполнения старинных туркменских&nbsp; ковров пишет искусствовед, специалист по истории ковроделия&nbsp;&nbsp; Е.Г. Царева: &laquo;Туркмены являются, по всей видимости, единственным ковродельческим народом, использующим не только разные типы узлов: симметричные, асимметричные открытые влево и вправо, с депрессией и без депрессии, &mdash; но и особые приемы вязки&raquo;. В своих коврах мы используем технические особенности в приемах узловязания, характерные для раннего туркменского ковроделия. Незаменимым сырьем для изготовления туркменских ковров ручной работы&nbsp; является шерсть сараджинской породы овец, которая разводится только в климатических условиях Туркменистана и имеет крайне ограниченный ареал распространения.</p>\\n<p>Сараджинская порода овец - созданная туркменским народом, обладает лучшим качеством шерсти, лишена мертвого волоса и с большим содержанием длинного пуха.&nbsp; Имеет неповторимый мерцающий блеск и шелковистость,&nbsp; что является отличительной и неповторимой особенностью туркменских ковров.&nbsp; Для создания наших ковров мы отбираем лучшую шерсть весенней стрижки. Промывается шерсть вручную только в самые жаркие летние месяцы для того чтобы при сушке на солнце она стала воздушной и сверкающей. После просушивания ее прочесывают на специальном гребне (дарак). Во время прочесывания идет отбор шерсти для основы и для пряжи. Для утка мы используем шерсть ягнят. Затем за дело берутся прядильщицы. Самуи́л Марты́нович&nbsp;<strong>Ду́дин</strong> русский этнограф, стоявший у истоков Этнографического музея в Санкт-Петербурге писал: &nbsp;&laquo;Пряжа изготовлялась возможно тщательнее с целью придать ей одинаковую скрученность и толщину на всем протяжении, и в этом отношении туркменками достигались результаты, почти не уступающие машинной выработке&raquo;. Каждая прядильщица,&nbsp; вручную, в день прядет не более 200-250 грамм, когда на небольшой ковер требуется около 12 кг.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>После получения нитей начинается процесс окрашивания, который может растягиваться&nbsp; до 5-6 месяцев, в зависимости от желаемого цвета.</p>\\n<p>В старину туркменские женщины большое внимание уделяли ферментации шерсти, которая обеспечивала проникновение протравы внутрь волокна. Ферментация позволяет&nbsp; добиваться стойкой и равномерной окраски, также усиливает&nbsp; эффект свечения нити. После полоскания нитей в проточной воде горных ручьев, нити окрашиваются. В качестве протравы использовались квасцы.&nbsp; Для растительного окрашивания и для закрепления окраски мы используем растения,&nbsp; произрастающие в песках Каракумы, и в предгорьях Копетдага.<strong> </strong>Надо сказать, что все растения,&nbsp; которые мы используем в окрашивании являются и лекарственными средствами.&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Нити подготовлены, мы подбираем нити для основы ковра. Учитывается толщина нити, степень крутки, при обязательном условии,&nbsp; что нити для основы должны быть спрядены одной прядильщицей, так как у каждой прядильщицы своя определенная степень крутки и степень натяжения. После того, как нити для тканья и для основы готовы, начинается подбор показателей для нити, которая должна стать утком и это очень ответственный момент. Ковры из чистой шерсти подвержены деформации и требуют бережного отношения.&nbsp; С.М. Дудин писал о лучших образцах туркменских ковров: &laquo;Они и были теми изделиями, которые всячески сохраняли, берегли, не пускали в повседневный домашний обиход, а показывали на свет только в особо важных, исключительных случаях (приезд гостей, праздники и т.п.)&raquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Сегодня с утком из чистой шерсти практически никто не работает, так как&nbsp; известно, что форма чистошерстяных ковров не всегда идеальна. Практически все производители&nbsp; используют&nbsp; основу для ковра и уток с добавлением химического волокна или специальный клей,&nbsp;&nbsp; который применяется&nbsp; с тыльной стороны ковра для фиксации формы.&nbsp; В наших коврах не используются химические компоненты.</p>\\n<p>В коврах ручной работы, как и во всех изделиях которые относятся к народному творчеству, особое значение имеет эстетическое содержание ковра, его художественная ценность.&nbsp; В ручном&nbsp; ковроткачестве, где используются геометрические, прямолинейные формы на больших площадях, очень хорошо прослеживается отклонение по симметрии и в то же время чрезвычайно сложно добиться полной симметрии ковра. Это некоторым образом связано с опытом и почерком ковровщицы, техникой уплотнения ковра группой женщин ткущих один ковёр. У каждого ковра даже при наборе одних и тех же орнаментов, будет своя отличительная особенность, связанная с ручным трудом. Близкая,&nbsp; к 100 процентам симметрия &ndash; достоинство,&nbsp; которое присуще машинному ковроткачеству. Поэтому при выборе ковров ручной работы из чистой шерсти &nbsp;&nbsp;на первый план выходит художественное содержание, без привлечения внимания на малозаметные погрешности.</p>\\n<p>В традициях и технологии ковроткачества туркмен заложена красота и долговечность.</p>\\n<p>Мы создаем свои ковры по восстановленным технологиям древности и это чисто экологический процесс.&nbsp;</p>"},{"languages_code":"tm","title":"Dikeldiş","description":"Irki döwrüň  ussatlarynyň syrlaryny we kiçijigem bolsa özboluşly tärini toplamak bilen, biz türkmen halysyny gadymy tehnologiýa boýunça dikeldýäris","content":"<p>Irki d&ouml;wr&uuml;ň&nbsp; ussatlarynyň syrlaryny we ki&ccedil;ijigem bolsa &ouml;zboluşly t&auml;rini toplamak bilen, biz t&uuml;rkmen halysyny gadymy tehnologi&yacute;a bo&yacute;un&ccedil;a dikeld&yacute;&auml;ris.

They are the carpets, with the energetics going back into millennia. It does not come to manual skills only,&nbsp; it is a kind of art which requires a great deal of knowledge, efforts, work, intuition, and, the main thing, genetic memory of the people who create our carpets.</p>\\n<p>It is an art at all its stages. The researcher of Turkmen carpets A. Felkerzam wrote: &ldquo;The one, who happened once to see ancient Turkmen carpets, will never confuse them with articles of other tribes and peoples for the reason of its unique decorative pattern, not even mentioning the technique&rdquo;. The technique of ancient carpet making is described by an arts critic and an expert on history of carpet-making&nbsp; E.G.Tsareva: &ldquo;Apparently, the Turkmens are the only carpets weaving nation, using not only different types of knots: symmetrical, asymmetrical opened to the left and to the right, with depression and without depression, but also special methods of tying&rdquo;. In our carpets we use technical peculiarities of knots tying methods, characteristic for early Turkmen carpet weaving. Indispensable raw material for manufacturing Turkmen hand-knotted carpets is wool of Sarajin sheep which is bred only in environmental conditions of Turkmenistan and has an extremely limited area of habitat.</p>\\n<p>The Sarajin breed of sheep, created by the Turkmen people, possesses better quality of wool, deprived of dead hair, and owns high content of long down. It has unique flickering flash and silkiness that are distinctive and typical features of Turkmen carpets. For creating our carpets, we select the best wool of spring shearing. Wool is washed manually, exclusively in the hottest summer months, in order to make it aerial and sparkling after drying it in the sun. Then the dry wool is carded with a special comb (<em>darak</em>). While carding the wool is sorted either for warp or for yarn. We use wool of lambs for a weft. Then spinners start working.</p>\\n<p>The Russian ethnographer, who was one of the founders of the Ethnographic museum in St.-Petersburg,&nbsp; Samuil Martynovich Dudin wrote: &ldquo;The yarn was produced with high accuracy to achieve maximum torsion and uniform thickness all over the thread; and, in this respect, Turkmen women reached the results which were almost comparable to mechanized produce&rdquo;. Every spinner, manually, spins no more than 200-250 grams a day, while almost 12 kg are required for a small carpet.</p>\\n<p>Once the threads are spun, the process of dyeing begins; it can be extended for 5-6 months, depending on desirable hue.</p>\\n<p>In old times Turkmen women paid great attention to fermentation of wool which provided penetration of mordant into fibers. The fermentation allows to achieve durable and uniform coloration; it also strengthens the gleaming of a thread. After rinsing of threads in running water of mountain brooks, threads are dyed. Alum are used as mordant. For vegetable dyeing and fixation of color we use the plants growing in the Karakum sands and the Kopet Dag foothills. It should be said that all the plants we use in dyeing are also medical products.</p>\\n<p>Since threads are prepared, we pick up threads for a carpet warp. We consider the thickness of threads and degree of torsion, providing an indispensable condition that threads for the warp should be spun by one spinner only, for the reason that every spinner is unique by a certain degree of spinning and range of tension. After threads for weaving and for a warp are ready, selection of a thread for the weft begins; and it is a crucial moment.</p>\\n<p>Carpets made of pure wool are subjects to deformation so they need careful handling. S. M. Dudin wrote about the best samples of Turkmen carpets:&ldquo;They were those articles which, in every possible way, were kept, protected, and not put into circulation in daily house use; they were exposed in light just on special important, exceptional occasions (arrival of visitors, holidays, etc.)&rdquo;.</p>\\n<p>Today, practically, nobody works with a weft made of pure wool; as it is known that the shape of all-wool carpets is not always ideal. In practice, almost all manufacturers use a warp and ducks with addition of chemical fiber or special glue, which is applied to the back side of a carpet to fix its shape. No chemical components are used in our carpets.</p>\\n<p>In hand-knotted carpets, as well as in all articles referring to folk creativity, the aesthetic content of a carpet, its artistic value has special meaning. In a manual carpet-weaving where geometric, rectilinear shapes on the big areas are used, the deflection on symmetry is traced very well; however, it is extremely difficult to achieve complete symmetry of a carpet. To some extent, it is connected with carpet-weaver&rsquo;s experience and handwriting, technique of compacting by the group of women weaving one carpet. Each carpet, even when it has a set of the same decorative patterns, will have the distinctive feature determined by manual skills. Symmetry, approximate to 100 percent, is an advantage which is inherent in machine-made carpets. Therefore, at a choice of hand-knotted fine wool carpets, the artistic content stands in the first place, without paying attention to unobtrusive flaws. Traditions and technology of Turkmen carpet-weaving are characterized by beauty and durability. We create our carpets following the restored ancient technologies and it is a fully ecological process.</p>","revival_id":"7c12ffcb-706c-40d9-9a7f-cae8cb4ad521"}	326

After threads for weaving and for a warp are ready, selection of a thread for the weft begins; and it is a crucial moment.</p>\\n<p>Carpets made of pure wool are subjects to deformation so they need careful handling. S. M. Dudin wrote about the best samples of Turkmen carpets:&ldquo;They were those articles which, in every possible way, were kept, protected, and not put into circulation in daily house use; they were exposed in light just on special important, exceptional occasions (arrival of visitors, holidays, etc.)&rdquo;.</p>\\n<p>Today, practically, nobody works with a weft made of pure wool; as it is known that the shape of all-wool carpets is not always ideal. In practice, almost all manufacturers use a warp and ducks with addition of chemical fiber or special glue, which is applied to the back side of a carpet to fix its shape. No chemical components are used in our carpets.</p>\\n<p>In hand-knotted carpets, as well as in all articles referring to folk creativity, the aesthetic content of a carpet, its artistic value has special meaning. In a manual carpet-weaving where geometric, rectilinear shapes on the big areas are used, the deflection on symmetry is traced very well; however, it is extremely difficult to achieve complete symmetry of a carpet. To some extent, it is connected with carpet-weaver&rsquo;s experience and handwriting, technique of compacting by the group of women weaving one carpet. Each carpet, even when it has a set of the same decorative patterns, will have the distinctive feature determined by manual skills. Symmetry, approximate to 100 percent, is an advantage which is inherent in machine-made carpets. Therefore, at a choice of hand-knotted fine wool carpets, the artistic content stands in the first place, without paying attention to unobtrusive flaws. Traditions and technology of Turkmen carpet-weaving are characterized by beauty and durability. We create our carpets following the restored ancient technologies and it is a fully ecological process.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"}	341

Исследователь туркменских ковров, А.Фелькерзам писал: Кому хоть раз пришлось видеть старинные туркменские ковры, тот никогда не спутает их с изделиями других племен и народов уже по одному орнаменту, не говоря о технике. О технике исполнения старинных туркменских ковров пишет искусствовед, специалист по истории ковроделия Е.Г. Царева: Туркмены являются, по всей видимости, единственным ковродельческим народом, использующим не только разные типы узлов: симметричные, асимметричные открытые влево и вправо, с депрессией и без депрессии, но и особые приемы вязки. В своих коврах мы используем технические особенности в приемах узловязания, характерные для раннего туркменского ковроделия. Незаменимым сырьем для изготовления туркменских ковров ручной работы является шерсть сараджинской породы овец, которая разводится только в климатических условиях Туркменистана и имеет крайне ограниченный ареал распространения.</p>\\n<p>Сараджинская порода овец - созданная туркменским народом, обладает лучшим качеством шерсти, лишена мертвого волоса и с большим содержанием длинного пуха. Имеет неповторимый мерцающий блеск и шелковистость, что является отличительной и неповторимой особенностью туркменских ковров. Для создания наших ковров мы отбираем лучшую шерсть весенней стрижки. Промывается шерсть вручную только в самые жаркие летние месяцы для того чтобы при сушке на солнце она стала воздушной и сверкающей. После просушивания ее прочесывают на специальном гребне (дарак). Во время прочесывания идет отбор шерсти для основы и для пряжи. Для утка мы используем шерсть ягнят. Затем за дело берутся прядильщицы. Самуи́л Марты́нович Ду́дин русский этнограф, стоявший у истоков Этнографического музея в Санкт-Петербурге писал: Пряжа изготовлялась возможно тщательнее с целью придать ей одинаковую скрученность и толщину на всем протяжении, и в этом отношении туркменками достигались результаты, почти не уступающие машинной выработке. Каждая прядильщица,&nbsp; вручную, в день прядет не более 200-250 грамм, когда на небольшой ковер требуется около 12 кг. После получения нитей начинается процесс окрашивания, который может растягиваться&nbsp; до 5-6 месяцев, в зависимости от желаемого цвета. В старину туркменские женщины большое внимание уделяли ферментации шерсти, которая обеспечивала проникновение протравы внутрь волокна. Ферментация позволяет&nbsp; добиваться стойкой и равномерной окраски, также усиливает эффект свечения нити. После полоскания нитей в проточной воде горных ручьев, нити окрашиваются. В качестве протравы использовались квасцы.&nbsp; Для растительного окрашивания и для закрепления окраски мы используем растения,&nbsp; произрастающие в песках Каракумы, и в предгорьях Копетдага. Надо сказать, что все растения,&nbsp; которые мы используем в окрашивании являются и лекарственными средствами. Нити подготовлены, мы подбираем нити для основы ковра. Учитывается толщина нити, степень крутки, при обязательном условии,&nbsp; что нити для основы должны быть спрядены одной прядильщицей, так как у каждой прядильщицы своя определенная степень крутки и степень натяжения. После того, как нити для тканья и для основы готовы, начинается подбор показателей для нити, которая должна стать утком и это очень ответственный момент. Ковры из чистой шерсти подвержены деформации и требуют бережного отношения.&nbsp; С.М. Дудин писал о лучших образцах туркменских ковров: Они и были теми изделиями, которые всячески сохраняли, берегли, не пускали в повседневный домашний обиход, а показывали на свет только в особо важных, исключительных случаях (приезд гостей, праздники и т.п.). Сегодня с утком из чистой шерсти практически никто не работает, так как известно, что форма чистошерстяных ковров не всегда идеальна. Практически все производители используют основу для ковра и уток с добавлением химического волокна или специальный клей, который применяется с тыльной стороны ковра для фиксации формы. В наших коврах не используются химические компоненты. В коврах ручной работы, как и во всех изделиях которые относятся к народному творчеству, особое значение имеет эстетическое содержание ковра, его художественная ценность. В ручном&nbsp; ковроткачестве, где используются геометрические, прямолинейные формы на больших площадях, очень хорошо прослеживается отклонение по симметрии и в то же время чрезвычайно сложно добиться полной симметрии ковра. Это некоторым образом связано с опытом и почерком ковровщицы, техникой уплотнения ковра группой женщин ткущих один ковёр. У каждого ковра даже при наборе одних и тех же орнаментов, будет своя отличительная особенность, связанная с ручным трудом. Близкая,&nbsp; к 100 процентам симметрия достоинство, которое присуще машинному ковроткачеству.

They are the carpets, with the energetics going back into millennia. It does not come to manual skills only,&nbsp; it is a kind of art which requires a great deal of knowledge, efforts, work, intuition, and, the main thing, genetic memory of the people who create our carpets.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>It is an art at all its stages. The researcher of Turkmen carpets A. Felkerzam wrote: &ldquo;The one, who happened once to see ancient Turkmen carpets, will never confuse them with articles of other tribes and peoples for the reason of its unique decorative pattern, not even mentioning the technique&rdquo;. The technique of ancient carpet making is described by an arts critic and an expert on history of carpet-making&nbsp; E.G.Tsareva: &ldquo;Apparently, the Turkmens are the only carpets weaving nation, using not only different types of knots: symmetrical, asymmetrical opened to the left and to the right, with depression and without depression, but also special methods of tying&rdquo;. In our carpets we use technical peculiarities of knots tying methods, characteristic for early Turkmen carpet weaving. Indispensable raw material for manufacturing Turkmen hand-knotted carpets is wool of Sarajin sheep which is bred only in environmental conditions of Turkmenistan and has an extremely limited area of habitat.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The Sarajin breed of sheep, created by the Turkmen people, possesses better quality of wool, deprived of dead hair, and owns high content of long down. It has unique flickering flash and silkiness that are distinctive and typical features of Turkmen carpets. For creating our carpets, we select the best wool of spring shearing. Wool is washed manually, exclusively in the hottest summer months, in order to make it aerial and sparkling after drying it in the sun. Then the dry wool is carded with a special comb (darak). While carding the wool is sorted either for warp or for yarn. We use wool of lambs for a weft. Then spinners start working.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The Russian ethnographer, who was one of the founders of the Ethnographic museum in St.-Petersburg,&nbsp; Samuil Martynovich Dudin wrote: &ldquo;The yarn was produced with high accuracy to achieve maximum torsion and uniform thickness all over the thread; and, in this respect, Turkmen women reached the results which were almost comparable to mechanized produce&rdquo;. Every spinner, manually, spins no more than 200-250 grams a day, while almost 12 kg are required for a small carpet.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Once the threads are spun, the process of dyeing begins; it can be extended for 5-6 months, depending on desirable hue.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>In old times Turkmen women paid great attention to fermentation of wool which provided penetration of mordant into fibers. The fermentation allows to achieve durable and uniform coloration; it also strengthens the gleaming of a thread. After rinsing of threads in running water of mountain brooks, threads are dyed. Alum are used as mordant. For vegetable dyeing and fixation of color we use the plants growing in the Karakum sands and the Kopet Dag foothills. It should be said that all the plants we use in dyeing are also medical products.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Since threads are prepared, we pick up threads for a carpet warp. We consider the thickness of threads and degree of torsion, providing an indispensable condition that threads for the warp should be spun by one spinner only, for the reason that every spinner is unique by a certain degree of spinning and range of tension. After threads for weaving and for a warp are ready, selection of a thread for the weft begins; and it is a crucial moment.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Carpets made of pure wool are subjects to deformation so they need careful handling. S. M. Dudin wrote about the best samples of Turkmen carpets:&ldquo;They were those articles which, in every possible way, were kept, protected, and not put into circulation in daily house use; they were exposed in light just on special important, exceptional occasions (arrival of visitors, holidays, etc.)&rdquo;.</p>\\n<p>Today, practically, nobody works with a weft made of pure wool; as it is known that the shape of all-wool carpets is not always ideal. In practice, almost all manufacturers use a warp and ducks with addition of chemical fiber or special glue, which is applied to the back side of a carpet to fix its shape. No chemical components are used in our carpets.</p>\\n<p>In hand-knotted carpets, as well as in all articles referring to folk creativity, the aesthetic content of a carpet, its artistic value has special meaning. In a manual carpet-weaving where geometric, rectilinear shapes on the big areas are used, the deflection on symmetry is traced very well; however, it is extremely difficult to achieve complete symmetry of a carpet. To some extent, it is connected with carpet-weaver&rsquo;s experience and handwriting, technique of compacting by the group of women weaving one carpet. Each carpet, even when it has a set of the same decorative patterns, will have the distinctive feature determined by manual skills. Symmetry, approximate to 100 percent, is an advantage which is inherent in machine-made carpets. Therefore, at a choice of hand-knotted fine wool carpets, the artistic content stands in the first place, without paying attention to unobtrusive flaws. Traditions and technology of Turkmen carpet-weaving are characterized by beauty and durability. We create our carpets following the restored ancient technologies and it is a fully ecological process.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","comment":null,"button":"Read more"}	{"revival_id":"7c12ffcb-706c-40d9-9a7f-cae8cb4ad521","languages_code":"en","button":"Read more"}	468

Ковры, энергетика которых уходит вглубь тысячелетий. Это не просто ручной труд, это - искусство, которое требует больших знаний, усилий, труда, интуиции, а главное генетической памяти людей, которые создают наши ковры.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Это - искусство на всех этапах создания. Исследователь туркменских ковров, А.Фелькерзам писал: Кому хоть раз пришлось видеть старинные туркменские ковры, тот никогда не спутает их с изделиями других племен и народов уже по одному орнаменту, не говоря о технике. О технике исполнения старинных туркменских ковров пишет искусствовед, специалист по истории ковроделия Е.Г. Царева: Туркмены являются, по всей видимости, единственным ковродельческим народом, использующим не только разные типы узлов: симметричные, асимметричные открытые влево и вправо, с депрессией и без депрессии, но и особые приемы вязки. В своих коврах мы используем технические особенности в приемах узловязания, характерные для раннего туркменского ковроделия. Незаменимым сырьем для изготовления туркменских ковров ручной работы является шерсть сараджинской породы овец, которая разводится только в климатических условиях Туркменистана и имеет крайне ограниченный ареал распространения.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Сараджинская порода овец - созданная туркменским народом, обладает лучшим качеством шерсти, лишена мертвого волоса и с большим содержанием длинного пуха. Имеет неповторимый мерцающий блеск и шелковистость, что является отличительной и неповторимой особенностью туркменских ковров. Для создания наших ковров мы отбираем лучшую шерсть весенней стрижки. Промывается шерсть вручную только в самые жаркие летние месяцы для того чтобы при сушке на солнце она стала воздушной и сверкающей. После просушивания ее прочесывают на специальном гребне (дарак). Во время прочесывания идет отбор шерсти для основы и для пряжи. Для утка мы используем шерсть ягнят. Затем за дело берутся прядильщицы. Самуи́л Марты́нович Ду́дин русский этнограф, стоявший у истоков Этнографического музея в Санкт-Петербурге писал: Пряжа изготовлялась возможно тщательнее с целью придать ей одинаковую скрученность и толщину на всем протяжении, и в этом отношении туркменками достигались результаты, почти не уступающие машинной выработке. Каждая прядильщица,&nbsp; вручную, в день прядет не более 200-250 грамм, когда на небольшой ковер требуется около 12 кг. После получения нитей начинается процесс окрашивания, который может растягиваться&nbsp; до 5-6 месяцев, в зависимости от желаемого цвета. В старину туркменские женщины большое внимание уделяли ферментации шерсти, которая обеспечивала проникновение протравы внутрь волокна. Ферментация позволяет&nbsp; добиваться стойкой и равномерной окраски, также усиливает эффект свечения нити. После полоскания нитей в проточной воде горных ручьев, нити окрашиваются. В качестве протравы использовались квасцы.&nbsp; Для растительного окрашивания и для закрепления окраски мы используем растения,&nbsp; произрастающие в песках Каракумы, и в предгорьях Копетдага. Надо сказать, что все растения,&nbsp; которые мы используем в окрашивании являются и лекарственными средствами. Нити подготовлены, мы подбираем нити для основы ковра. Учитывается толщина нити, степень крутки, при обязательном условии,&nbsp; что нити для основы должны быть спрядены одной прядильщицей, так как у каждой прядильщицы своя определенная степень крутки и степень натяжения. После того, как нити для тканья и для основы готовы, начинается подбор показателей для нити, которая должна стать утком и это очень ответственный момент. Ковры из чистой шерсти подвержены деформации и требуют бережного отношения.&nbsp; С.М. Дудин писал о лучших образцах туркменских ковров: Они и были теми изделиями, которые всячески сохраняли, берегли, не пускали в повседневный домашний обиход, а показывали на свет только в особо важных, исключительных случаях (приезд гостей, праздники и т.п.). Сегодня с утком из чистой шерсти практически никто не работает, так как известно, что форма чистошерстяных ковров не всегда идеальна. Практически все производители используют основу для ковра и уток с добавлением химического волокна или специальный клей, который применяется с тыльной стороны ковра для фиксации формы. В наших коврах не используются химические компоненты. В коврах ручной работы, как и во всех изделиях которые относятся к народному творчеству, особое значение имеет эстетическое содержание ковра, его художественная ценность. В ручном&nbsp; ковроткачестве, где используются геометрические, прямолинейные формы на больших площадях, очень хорошо прослеживается отклонение по симметрии и в то же время чрезвычайно сложно добиться полной симметрии ковра. Это некоторым образом связано с опытом и почерком ковровщицы, техникой уплотнения ковра группой женщин ткущих один ковёр. У каждого ковра даже при наборе одних и тех же орнаментов, будет своя отличительная особенность, связанная с ручным трудом. Близкая,&nbsp; к 100 процентам симметрия достоинство, которое присуще машинному ковроткачеству. Поэтому при выборе ковров ручной работы из чистой шерсти на первый план выходит художественное содержание, без привлечения внимания на малозаметные погрешности. В традициях и технологии ковроткачества туркмен заложена красота и долговечность. Мы создаем свои ковры по восстановленным технологиям древности и это чисто экологический процесс.</p>","comment":null,"button":"Читать дальше"}	{"revival_id":"7c12ffcb-706c-40d9-9a7f-cae8cb4ad521","languages_code":"ru","button":"Читать дальше"}	468

They are the carpets, with the energetics going back into millennia. It does not come to manual skills only,  it is a kind of art which requires a great deal of knowledge, efforts, work, intuition, and, the main thing, genetic memory of the people who create our carpets.\\n \\nIt is an art at all its stages. The researcher of Turkmen carpets A. Felkerzam wrote: “The one, who happened once to see ancient Turkmen carpets, will never confuse them with articles of other tribes and peoples for the reason of its unique decorative pattern, not even mentioning the technique”. The technique of ancient carpet making is described by an arts critic and an expert on history of carpet-making  E.G.Tsareva: “Apparently, the Turkmens are the only carpets weaving nation, using not only different types of knots: symmetrical, asymmetrical opened to the left and to the right, with depression and without depression, but also special methods of tying”. In our carpets we use technical peculiarities of knots tying methods, characteristic for early Turkmen carpet weaving. Indispensable raw material for manufacturing Turkmen hand-knotted carpets is wool of Sarajin sheep which is bred only in environmental conditions of Turkmenistan and has an extremely limited area of habitat. \\n\\nThe Sarajin breed of sheep, created by the Turkmen people, possesses better quality of wool, deprived of dead hair, and owns high content of long down. It has unique flickering flash and silkiness that are distinctive and typical features of Turkmen carpets. For creating our carpets, we select the best wool of spring shearing. Wool is washed manually, exclusively in the hottest summer months, in order to make it aerial and sparkling after drying it in the sun. Then the dry wool is carded with a special comb (darak). While carding the wool is sorted either for warp or for yarn. We use wool of lambs for a weft. Then spinners start working.\\n\\nThe Russian ethnographer, who was one of the founders of the Ethnographic museum in St.-Petersburg,  Samuil Martynovich Dudin wrote: “The yarn was produced with high accuracy to achieve maximum torsion and uniform thickness all over the thread; and, in this respect, Turkmen women reached the results which were almost comparable to mechanized produce”. Every spinner, manually, spins no more than 200-250 grams a day, while almost 12 kg are required for a small carpet.\\nOnce the threads are spun, the process of dyeing begins; it can be extended for 5-6 months, depending on desirable hue. \\n\\nIn old times Turkmen women paid great attention to fermentation of wool which provided penetration of mordant into fibers. The fermentation allows to achieve durable and uniform coloration; it also strengthens the gleaming of a thread. After rinsing of threads in running water of mountain brooks, threads are dyed. Alum are used as mordant. For vegetable dyeing and fixation of color we use the plants growing in the Karakum sands and the Kopet Dag foothills. It should be said that all the plants we use in dyeing are also medical products.\\n\\nSince threads are prepared, we pick up threads for a carpet warp. We consider the thickness of threads and degree of torsion, providing an indispensable condition that threads for the warp should be spun by one spinner only, for the reason that every spinner is unique by a certain degree of spinning and range of tension. After threads for weaving and for a warp are ready, selection of a thread for the weft begins; and it is a crucial moment. \\n\\nCarpets made of pure wool are subjects to deformation so they need careful handling. S. M. Dudin wrote about the best samples of Turkmen carpets:“They were those articles which, in every possible way, were kept, protected, and not put into circulation in daily house use; they were exposed in light just on special important, exceptional occasions (arrival of visitors, holidays, etc.)”. \\nToday, practically, nobody works with a weft made of pure wool; as it is known that the shape of all-wool carpets is not always ideal. In practice, almost all manufacturers use a warp and ducks with addition of chemical fiber or special glue, which is applied to the back side of a carpet to fix its shape. No chemical components are used in our carpets.\\n\\nIn hand-knotted carpets, as well as in all articles referring to folk creativity, the aesthetic content of a carpet, its artistic value has special meaning. In a manual carpet-weaving where geometric, rectilinear shapes on the big areas are used, the deflection on symmetry is traced very well; however, it is extremely difficult to achieve complete symmetry of a carpet. To some extent, it is connected with carpet-weaver’s experience and handwriting, technique of compacting by the group of women weaving one carpet. Each carpet, even when it has a set of the same decorative patterns, will have the distinctive feature determined by manual skills. Symmetry, approximate to 100 percent, is an advantage which is inherent in machine-made carpets. Therefore, at a choice of hand-knotted fine wool carpets, the artistic content stands in the first place, without paying attention to unobtrusive flaws. Traditions and technology of Turkmen carpet-weaving are characterized by beauty and durability. We create our carpets following the restored ancient technologies and it is a fully ecological process.","description":"Collecting nuances and old craftsmen’s secrets by crumbs, we revive Turkmen carpets in accordance with the forgotten ancient technologies.

Ковры, энергетика которых уходит вглубь тысячелетий. Это не просто ручной труд,  это -  искусство, которое требует  больших знаний, усилий, труда, интуиции,  а главное генетической памяти  людей, которые создают наши ковры. Это -  искусство на всех этапах создания.  Исследователь туркменских ковров,  А.Фелькерзам писал: «Кому хоть раз пришлось видеть старинные туркменские ковры, тот никогда не спутает их с изделиями других племен и народов уже по одному орнаменту, не говоря о технике». О технике исполнения старинных туркменских  ковров пишет искусствовед, специалист по истории ковроделия   Е.Г. Царева: «Туркмены являются, по всей видимости, единственным ковродельческим народом, использующим не только разные типы узлов: симметричные, асимметричные открытые влево и вправо, с депрессией и без депрессии, — но и особые приемы вязки». В своих коврах мы используем технические особенности в приемах узловязания, характерные для раннего туркменского ковроделия. Незаменимым сырьем для изготовления туркменских ковров ручной работы  является шерсть сараджинской породы овец, которая разводится только в климатических условиях Туркменистана и имеет крайне ограниченный ареал распространения. Сараджинская порода овец - созданная туркменским народом, обладает лучшим качеством шерсти, лишена мертвого волоса и с большим содержанием длинного пуха.  Имеет неповторимый мерцающий блеск и шелковистость,  что является отличительной и неповторимой особенностью туркменских ковров.  Для создания наших ковров мы отбираем лучшую шерсть весенней стрижки. Промывается шерсть вручную только в самые жаркие летние месяцы для того чтобы при сушке на солнце она стала воздушной и сверкающей. После просушивания ее прочесывают на специальном гребне (дарак). Во время прочесывания идет отбор шерсти для основы и для пряжи. Для утка мы используем шерсть ягнят. Затем за дело берутся прядильщицы. Самуи́л Марты́нович Ду́дин русский этнограф, стоявший у истоков Этнографического музея в Санкт-Петербурге писал:  «Пряжа изготовлялась возможно тщательнее с целью придать ей одинаковую скрученность и толщину на всем протяжении, и в этом отношении туркменками достигались результаты, почти не уступающие машинной выработке». Каждая прядильщица,  вручную, в день прядет не более 200-250 грамм, когда на небольшой ковер требуется около 12 кг.  После получения нитей начинается процесс окрашивания, который может растягиваться  до 5-6 месяцев, в зависимости от желаемого цвета. В старину туркменские женщины большое внимание уделяли ферментации шерсти, которая обеспечивала проникновение протравы внутрь волокна. Ферментация позволяет  добиваться стойкой и равномерной окраски, также усиливает  эффект свечения нити. После полоскания нитей в проточной воде горных ручьев, нити окрашиваются. В качестве протравы использовались квасцы.  Для растительного окрашивания и для закрепления окраски мы используем растения,  произрастающие в песках Каракумы, и в предгорьях Копетдага. Надо сказать, что все растения,  которые мы используем в окрашивании являются и лекарственными средствами.  Нити подготовлены, мы подбираем нити для основы ковра. Учитывается толщина нити, степень крутки, при обязательном условии,  что нити для основы должны быть спрядены одной прядильщицей, так как у каждой прядильщицы своя определенная степень крутки и степень натяжения. После того, как нити для тканья и для основы готовы, начинается подбор показателей для нити, которая должна стать утком и это очень ответственный момент. Ковры из чистой шерсти подвержены деформации и требуют бережного отношения.  С.М. Дудин писал о лучших образцах туркменских ковров: «Они и были теми изделиями, которые всячески сохраняли, берегли, не пускали в повседневный домашний обиход, а показывали на свет только в особо важных, исключительных случаях (приезд гостей, праздники и т.п.)».   Сегодня с утком из чистой шерсти практически никто не работает, так как  известно, что форма чистошерстяных ковров не всегда идеальна. Практически все производители  используют  основу для ковра и уток с добавлением химического волокна или специальный клей,   который применяется  с тыльной стороны ковра для фиксации формы.  В наших коврах не используются химические компоненты.\\n\\nВ коврах ручной работы, как и во всех изделиях которые относятся к народному творчеству, особое значение имеет эстетическое содержание ковра, его художественная ценность.  В ручном  ковроткачестве, где используются геометрические, прямолинейные формы на больших площадях, очень хорошо прослеживается отклонение по симметрии и в то же время чрезвычайно сложно добиться полной симметрии ковра. Это некоторым образом связано с опытом и почерком ковровщицы, техникой уплотнения ковра группой женщин ткущих один ковёр. У каждого ковра даже при наборе одних и тех же орнаментов, будет своя отличительная особенность, связанная с ручным трудом. Близкая,  к 100 процентам симметрия – достоинство,  которое присуще машинному ковроткачеству. Поэтому при выборе ковров ручной работы из чистой шерсти   на первый план выходит художественное содержание, без привлечения внимания на малозаметные погрешности.\\nВ традициях и технологии ковроткачества туркмен заложена красота и долговечность.\\nМы создаем свои ковры по восстановленным технологиям древности и это чисто экологический процесс.","description":"Собирая по крупицам нюансы и секреты старых мастеров, мы возрождаем  туркменские ковры по забытым технологиям древности.

Felkerzam wrote: &ldquo;The one, who happened once to see ancient Turkmen carpets, will never confuse them with articles of other tribes and peoples for the reason of its unique decorative pattern, not even mentioning the technique&rdquo;. The technique of ancient carpet making is described by an arts critic and an expert on history of carpet-making E.G.Tsareva: &ldquo;Apparently, the Turkmens are the only carpets weaving nation, using not only different types of knots: symmetrical, asymmetrical opened to the left and to the right, with depression and without depression, but also special methods of tying&rdquo;.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>In our carpets we use technical peculiarities of knots tying methods, characteristic for early Turkmen carpet weaving. Indispensable raw material for manufacturing Turkmen hand-knotted carpets is wool of Sarajin sheep which is bred only in environmental conditions of Turkmenistan and has an extremely limited area of habitat. The Sarajin breed of sheep, created by the Turkmen people, possesses better quality of wool, deprived of dead hair, and owns high content of long down. It has unique flickering flash and silkiness that are distinctive and typical features of Turkmen carpets. For creating our carpets, we select the best wool of spring shearing. Wool is washed manually, exclusively in the hottest summer months, in order to make it aerial and sparkling after drying it in the sun. Then the dry wool is carded with a special comb (darak). While carding the wool is sorted either for warp or for yarn. We use wool of lambs for a weft. Then spinners start working.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The Russian ethnographer, who was one of the founders of the Ethnographic museum in St.-Petersburg, Samuil Martynovich Dudin wrote: &ldquo;The yarn was produced with high accuracy to achieve maximum torsion and uniform thickness all over the thread; and, in this respect, Turkmen women reached the results which were almost comparable to mechanized produce&rdquo;. Every spinner, manually, spins no more than 200-250 grams a day, while almost 12 kg are required for a small carpet. Once the threads are spun, the process of dyeing begins; it can be extended for 5-6 months, depending on desirable hue. In old times Turkmen women paid great attention to fermentation of wool which provided penetration of mordant into fibers.

Felkerzam wrote: &ldquo;The one, who happened once to see ancient Turkmen carpets, will never confuse them with articles of other tribes and peoples for the reason of its unique decorative pattern, not even mentioning the technique&rdquo;. The technique of ancient carpet making is described by an arts critic and an expert on history of carpet-making E.G.Tsareva: &ldquo;Apparently, the Turkmens are the only carpets weaving nation, using not only different types of knots: symmetrical, asymmetrical opened to the left and to the right, with depression and without depression, but also special methods of tying&rdquo;.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>In our carpets we use technical peculiarities of knots tying methods, characteristic for early Turkmen carpet weaving. Indispensable raw material for manufacturing Turkmen hand-knotted carpets is wool of Sarajin sheep which is bred only in environmental conditions of Turkmenistan and has an extremely limited area of habitat. The Sarajin breed of sheep, created by the Turkmen people, possesses better quality of wool, deprived of dead hair, and owns high content of long down. It has unique flickering flash and silkiness that are distinctive and typical features of Turkmen carpets. For creating our carpets, we select the best wool of spring shearing. Wool is washed manually, exclusively in the hottest summer months, in order to make it aerial and sparkling after drying it in the sun. Then the dry wool is carded with a special comb (darak). While carding the wool is sorted either for warp or for yarn. We use wool of lambs for a weft. Then spinners start working.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The Russian ethnographer, who was one of the founders of the Ethnographic museum in St.-Petersburg, Samuil Martynovich Dudin wrote: &ldquo;The yarn was produced with high accuracy to achieve maximum torsion and uniform thickness all over the thread; and, in this respect, Turkmen women reached the results which were almost comparable to mechanized produce&rdquo;. Every spinner, manually, spins no more than 200-250 grams a day, while almost 12 kg are required for a small carpet. Once the threads are spun, the process of dyeing begins; it can be extended for 5-6 months, depending on desirable hue. In old times Turkmen women paid great attention to fermentation of wool which provided penetration of mordant into fibers. The fermentation allows to achieve durable and uniform coloration; it also strengthens the gleaming of a thread.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>After rinsing of threads in running water of mountain brooks, threads are dyed.

Ковры, энергетика которых уходит вглубь тысячелетий. Это не просто ручной труд, это - искусство, которое требует больших знаний, усилий, труда, интуиции, а главное генетической памяти людей, которые создают наши ковры. Это - искусство на всех этапах создания. Исследователь туркменских ковров, А.Фелькерзам писал: &laquo;Кому хоть раз пришлось видеть старинные туркменские ковры, тот никогда не спутает их с изделиями других племен и народов уже по одному орнаменту, не говоря о технике&raquo;.</p>\\n<p>О технике исполнения старинных туркменских ковров пишет искусствовед, специалист по истории ковроделия Е.Г. Царева: &laquo;Туркмены являются, по всей видимости, единственным ковродельческим народом, использующим не только разные типы узлов: симметричные, асимметричные открытые влево и вправо, с депрессией и без депрессии, &mdash; но и особые приемы вязки&raquo;. В своих коврах мы используем технические особенности в приемах узловязания, характерные для раннего туркменского ковроделия. Незаменимым сырьем для изготовления туркменских ковров ручной работы является шерсть сараджинской породы овец, которая разводится только в климатических условиях Туркменистана и имеет крайне ограниченный ареал распространения. Сараджинская порода овец - созданная туркменским народом, обладает лучшим качеством шерсти, лишена мертвого волоса и с большим содержанием длинного пуха. Имеет неповторимый мерцающий блеск и шелковистость, что является отличительной и неповторимой особенностью туркменских ковров. Для создания наших ковров мы отбираем лучшую шерсть весенней стрижки. Промывается шерсть вручную только в самые жаркие летние месяцы для того чтобы при сушке на солнце она стала воздушной и сверкающей. После просушивания ее прочесывают на специальном гребне (дарак). Во время прочесывания идет отбор шерсти для основы и для пряжи. Для утка мы используем шерсть ягнят. Затем за дело берутся прядильщицы. Самуи́л Марты́нович Ду́дин русский этнограф, стоявший у истоков Этнографического музея в Санкт-Петербурге писал: &laquo;Пряжа изготовлялась возможно тщательнее с целью придать ей одинаковую скрученность и толщину на всем протяжении, и в этом отношении туркменками достигались результаты, почти не уступающие машинной выработке&raquo;. Каждая прядильщица, вручную, в день прядет не более 200-250 грамм, когда на небольшой ковер требуется около 12 кг. После получения нитей начинается процесс окрашивания, который может растягиваться до 5-6 месяцев, в зависимости от желаемого цвета. В старину туркменские женщины большое внимание уделяли ферментации шерсти, которая обеспечивала проникновение протравы внутрь волокна. Ферментация позволяет добиваться стойкой и равномерной окраски, также усиливает эффект свечения нити. После полоскания нитей в проточной воде горных ручьев, нити окрашиваются. В качестве протравы использовались квасцы. Для растительного окрашивания и для закрепления окраски мы используем растения, произрастающие в песках Каракумы, и в предгорьях Копетдага. Надо сказать, что все растения, которые мы используем в окрашивании являются и лекарственными средствами. Нити подготовлены, мы подбираем нити для основы ковра. Учитывается толщина нити, степень крутки, при обязательном условии, что нити для основы должны быть спрядены одной прядильщицей, так как у каждой прядильщицы своя определенная степень крутки и степень натяжения. После того, как нити для тканья и для основы готовы, начинается подбор показателей для нити, которая должна стать утком и это очень ответственный момент. Ковры из чистой шерсти подвержены деформации и требуют бережного отношения. С.М. Дудин писал о лучших образцах туркменских ковров: &laquo;Они и были теми изделиями, которые всячески сохраняли, берегли, не пускали в повседневный домашний обиход, а показывали на свет только в особо важных, исключительных случаях (приезд гостей, праздники и т.п.)&raquo;. Сегодня с утком из чистой шерсти практически никто не работает, так как известно, что форма чистошерстяных ковров не всегда идеальна. Практически все производители используют основу для ковра и уток с добавлением химического волокна или специальный клей, который применяется с тыльной стороны ковра для фиксации формы. В наших коврах не используются химические компоненты. В коврах ручной работы, как и во всех изделиях которые относятся к народному творчеству, особое значение имеет эстетическое содержание ковра, его художественная ценность. В ручном ковроткачестве, где используются геометрические, прямолинейные формы на больших площадях, очень хорошо прослеживается отклонение по симметрии и в то же время чрезвычайно сложно добиться полной симметрии ковра. Это некоторым образом связано с опытом и почерком ковровщицы, техникой уплотнения ковра группой женщин ткущих один ковёр. У каждого ковра даже при наборе одних и тех же орнаментов, будет своя отличительная особенность, связанная с ручным трудом. Близкая, к 100 процентам симметрия &ndash; достоинство, которое присуще машинному ковроткачеству. Поэтому при выборе ковров ручной работы из чистой шерсти на первый план выходит художественное содержание, без привлечения внимания на малозаметные погрешности. В традициях и технологии ковроткачества туркмен заложена красота и долговечность.

Ковры, энергетика которых уходит вглубь тысячелетий. Это не просто ручной труд, это - искусство, которое требует больших знаний, усилий, труда, интуиции, а главное генетической памяти людей, которые создают наши ковры. Это - искусство на всех этапах создания. Исследователь туркменских ковров, А.Фелькерзам писал: &laquo;Кому хоть раз пришлось видеть старинные туркменские ковры, тот никогда не спутает их с изделиями других племен и народов уже по одному орнаменту, не говоря о технике&raquo;.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>О технике исполнения старинных туркменских ковров пишет искусствовед, специалист по истории ковроделия Е.Г.

В своих коврах мы используем технические особенности в приемах узловязания, характерные для раннего туркменского ковроделия. Незаменимым сырьем для изготовления туркменских ковров ручной работы является шерсть сараджинской породы овец, которая разводится только в климатических условиях Туркменистана и имеет крайне ограниченный ареал распространения.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Сараджинская порода овец - созданная туркменским народом, обладает лучшим качеством шерсти, лишена мертвого волоса и с большим содержанием длинного пуха. Имеет неповторимый мерцающий блеск и шелковистость, что является отличительной и неповторимой особенностью туркменских ковров. Для создания наших ковров мы отбираем лучшую шерсть весенней стрижки. Промывается шерсть вручную только в самые жаркие летние месяцы для того чтобы при сушке на солнце она стала воздушной и сверкающей. После просушивания ее прочесывают на специальном гребне (дарак). Во время прочесывания идет отбор шерсти для основы и для пряжи. Для утка мы используем шерсть ягнят. Затем за дело берутся прядильщицы. Самуи́л Марты́нович Ду́дин русский этнограф, стоявший у истоков Этнографического музея в Санкт-Петербурге писал: &laquo;Пряжа изготовлялась возможно тщательнее с целью придать ей одинаковую скрученность и толщину на всем протяжении, и в этом отношении туркменками достигались результаты, почти не уступающие машинной выработке&raquo;. Каждая прядильщица, вручную, в день прядет не более 200-250 грамм, когда на небольшой ковер требуется около 12 кг. После получения нитей начинается процесс окрашивания, который может растягиваться до 5-6 месяцев, в зависимости от желаемого цвета. В старину туркменские женщины большое внимание уделяли ферментации шерсти, которая обеспечивала проникновение протравы внутрь волокна. Ферментация позволяет добиваться стойкой и равномерной окраски, также усиливает эффект свечения нити. После полоскания нитей в проточной воде горных ручьев, нити окрашиваются. В качестве протравы использовались квасцы. Для растительного окрашивания и для закрепления окраски мы используем растения, произрастающие в песках Каракумы, и в предгорьях Копетдага. Надо сказать, что все растения, которые мы используем в окрашивании являются и лекарственными средствами. Нити подготовлены, мы подбираем нити для основы ковра. Учитывается толщина нити, степень крутки, при обязательном условии, что нити для основы должны быть спрядены одной прядильщицей, так как у каждой прядильщицы своя определенная степень крутки и степень натяжения. После того, как нити для тканья и для основы готовы, начинается подбор показателей для нити, которая должна стать утком и это очень ответственный момент. Ковры из чистой шерсти подвержены деформации и требуют бережного отношения. С.М. Дудин писал о лучших образцах туркменских ковров: &laquo;Они и были теми изделиями, которые всячески сохраняли, берегли, не пускали в повседневный домашний обиход, а показывали на свет только в особо важных, исключительных случаях (приезд гостей, праздники и т.п.)&raquo;. Сегодня с утком из чистой шерсти практически никто не работает, так как известно, что форма чистошерстяных ковров не всегда идеальна. Практически все производители используют основу для ковра и уток с добавлением химического волокна или специальный клей, который применяется с тыльной стороны ковра для фиксации формы. В наших коврах не используются химические компоненты. В коврах ручной работы, как и во всех изделиях которые относятся к народному творчеству, особое значение имеет эстетическое содержание ковра, его художественная ценность. В ручном ковроткачестве, где используются геометрические, прямолинейные формы на больших площадях, очень хорошо прослеживается отклонение по симметрии и в то же время чрезвычайно сложно добиться полной симметрии ковра. Это некоторым образом связано с опытом и почерком ковровщицы, техникой уплотнения ковра группой женщин ткущих один ковёр. У каждого ковра даже при наборе одних и тех же орнаментов, будет своя отличительная особенность, связанная с ручным трудом. Близкая, к 100 процентам симметрия &ndash; достоинство, которое присуще машинному ковроткачеству. Поэтому при выборе ковров ручной работы из чистой шерсти на первый план выходит художественное содержание, без привлечения внимания на малозаметные погрешности.

The sheep of that breed was bred by the method of national selection in the southeastern part of Turkmenistan. The breed received its name from a village of Sary-Dja, located near the town of Mary.

The basic properties of Sarajin sheep wool are braid-like structure of the fleece, consisting of the soft braids, mainly containing the down (not shorter than 55 mm) and transitive fibers, including insignificant quantity of thin awns. The wool is strong on breakage. A thickness of a fiber is 20-26 micron. The colors are white, light grey, and grey. It contains vegetable impurities (about 1 %) and mineral impurities (about 4 %). The length of the wool is 18-20 cm, besides, the length of a down zone is 9-10 cm. Sarajin rams and sheep are extremely robust and unpretentious. The climate, in which it was bred, is harsh&ndash; in summer the stem of a thermometer rises above 40 degrees, and in winter bitter cold occurs in Turkmenistan. The breed is well adapted to all-year-round grazing in the conditions of the Karakum desert and the Kopetdag foothills. The wool for the carpet is sheared in the spring when the fibers are longer and stronger. The wool shorn in the spring is not a subject for export. It is a raw material for creating the most beautiful and expensive carpets.</p>","description":"A Turkmen carpet has a surprising merit.

Лучших особей отличающихся лучшими показателями по шерстной продуктивности разводили внутри племени. Основные технические характеристики шерсти сараджинской породы овец: -косичное строение руна, состоящая из мягких косиц, содержащее в основном пух (не короче 55 мм) и переходные волокна, а также незначительное количество тонкой ости. Шерсть прочная на разрыв. Толщина волокна - 20-26 микрон. Цвета - белый, светло-серый, серый. Содержит растительные примеси - до 1 %, минеральные примеси: до 4%. Длина шерсти 18-20 см, при этом длина пуховой зоны 9-10 см. Сараджинские бараны и овцы чрезвычайно выносливы и неприхотливы. Климат, где они были выведены, тяжёлый &ndash; летом столбик термометра повышается до значений выше 40 градусов, а зимой в Туркменистане бывают сильные морозы.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>Порода хорошо приспособлена к круглогодовому пастбищному содержанию в условиях пустыни Карамумы и предгорья Копетдага. Шерсть для ковров берут в весеннюю стрижку, так как её волокна длинные и прочные. Шерсть сараджинской породы весенней стрижки не подлежит экспорту. Она является необходимым сырьем для создания самых красивых и дорогих ковров.</p>","description":"Туркменский ковер имеет удивительное достоинство.

They are the carpets, with the energetics going back into millennia. It does not come to manual skills only, it is a kind of art which requires a great deal of knowledge, efforts, work, intuition, and, the main thing, genetic memory of the people who create our carpets. It is an art at all its stages.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The researcher of Turkmen carpets A. Felkerzam wrote: &ldquo;The one, who happened once to see ancient Turkmen carpets, will never confuse them with articles of other tribes and peoples for the reason of its unique decorative pattern, not even mentioning the technique&rdquo;. The technique of ancient carpet making is described by an arts critic and an expert on history of carpet-making E.G.Tsareva: &ldquo;Apparently, the Turkmens are the only carpets weaving nation, using not only different types of knots: symmetrical, asymmetrical opened to the left and to the right, with depression and without depression, but also special methods of tying&rdquo;.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>In our carpets we use technical peculiarities of knots tying methods, characteristic for early Turkmen carpet weaving. Indispensable raw material for manufacturing Turkmen hand-knotted carpets is wool of Sarajin sheep which is bred only in environmental conditions of Turkmenistan and has an extremely limited area of habitat. The Sarajin breed of sheep, created by the Turkmen people, possesses better quality of wool, deprived of dead hair, and owns high content of long down. It has unique flickering flash and silkiness that are distinctive and typical features of Turkmen carpets. For creating our carpets, we select the best wool of spring shearing. Wool is washed manually, exclusively in the hottest summer months, in order to make it aerial and sparkling after drying it in the sun. Then the dry wool is carded with a special comb (darak). While carding the wool is sorted either for warp or for yarn. We use wool of lambs for a weft. Then spinners start working.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>The Russian ethnographer, who was one of the founders of the Ethnographic museum in St.-Petersburg, Samuil Martynovich Dudin wrote: &ldquo;The yarn was produced with high accuracy to achieve maximum torsion and uniform thickness all over the thread; and, in this respect, Turkmen women reached the results which were almost comparable to mechanized produce&rdquo;. Every spinner, manually, spins no more than 200-250 grams a day, while almost 12 kg are required for a small carpet. Once the threads are spun, the process of dyeing begins; it can be extended for 5-6 months, depending on desirable hue. In old times Turkmen women paid great attention to fermentation of wool which provided penetration of mordant into fibers. The fermentation allows to achieve durable and uniform coloration; it also strengthens the gleaming of a thread.</p>\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\n<p>After rinsing of threads in running water of mountain brooks, threads are dyed. Alum are used as mordant. For vegetable dyeing and fixation of color we use the plants growing in the Karakum sands and the Kopet Dag foothills. It should be said that all the plants we use in dyeing are also medical products. Since threads are prepared, we pick up threads for a carpet warp.

They are the carpets, with the energetics going back into millennia. It does not come to manual skills only,&nbsp; it is a kind of art which requires a great deal of knowledge, efforts, work, intuition, and, the main thing, genetic memory of the people who create our carpets.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is an art at all its stages. The researcher of Turkmen carpets A. Felkerzam wrote: &ldquo;The one, who happened once to see ancient Turkmen carpets, will never confuse them with articles of other tribes and peoples for the reason of its unique decorative pattern, not even mentioning the technique&rdquo;. The technique of ancient carpet making is described by an arts critic and an expert on history of carpet-making&nbsp; E.G.Tsareva: &ldquo;Apparently, the Turkmens are the only carpets weaving nation, using not only different types of knots: symmetrical, asymmetrical opened to the left and to the right, with depression and without depression, but also special methods of tying&rdquo;. In our carpets we use technical peculiarities of knots tying methods, characteristic for early Turkmen carpet weaving. Indispensable raw material for manufacturing Turkmen hand-knotted carpets is wool of Sarajin sheep which is bred only in environmental conditions of Turkmenistan and has an extremely limited area of habitat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sarajin breed of sheep, created by the Turkmen people, possesses better quality of wool, deprived of dead hair, and owns high content of long down. It has unique flickering flash and silkiness that are distinctive and typical features of Turkmen carpets. For creating our carpets, we select the best wool of spring shearing. Wool is washed manually, exclusively in the hottest summer months, in order to make it aerial and sparkling after drying it in the sun. Then the dry wool is carded with a special comb (darak). While carding the wool is sorted either for warp or for yarn. We use wool of lambs for a weft. Then spinners start working.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Russian ethnographer, who was one of the founders of the Ethnographic museum in St.-Petersburg,&nbsp; Samuil Martynovich Dudin wrote: &ldquo;The yarn was produced with high accuracy to achieve maximum torsion and uniform thickness all over the thread; and, in this respect, Turkmen women reached the results which were almost comparable to mechanized produce&rdquo;. Every spinner, manually, spins no more than 200-250 grams a day, while almost 12 kg are required for a small carpet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Once the threads are spun, the process of dyeing begins; it can be extended for 5-6 months, depending on desirable hue.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In old times Turkmen women paid great attention to fermentation of wool which provided penetration of mordant into fibers. The fermentation allows to achieve durable and uniform coloration; it also strengthens the gleaming of a thread. After rinsing of threads in running water of mountain brooks, threads are dyed. Alum are used as mordant. For vegetable dyeing and fixation of color we use the plants growing in the Karakum sands and the Kopet Dag foothills. It should be said that all the plants we use in dyeing are also medical products.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since threads are prepared, we pick up threads for a carpet warp. We consider the thickness of threads and degree of torsion, providing an indispensable condition that threads for the warp should be spun by one spinner only, for the reason that every spinner is unique by a certain degree of spinning and range of tension. After threads for weaving and for a warp are ready, selection of a thread for the weft begins; and it is a crucial moment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Carpets made of pure wool are subjects to deformation so they need careful handling. S. M. Dudin wrote about the best samples of Turkmen carpets:&ldquo;They were those articles which, in every possible way, were kept, protected, and not put into circulation in daily house use; they were exposed in light just on special important, exceptional occasions (arrival of visitors, holidays, etc.)&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Today, practically, nobody works with a weft made of pure wool; as it is known that the shape of all-wool carpets is not always ideal. In practice, almost all manufacturers use a warp and ducks with addition of chemical fiber or special glue, which is applied to the back side of a carpet to fix its shape. No chemical components are used in our carpets.</p>\n<p>In hand-knotted carpets, as well as in all articles referring to folk creativity, the aesthetic content of a carpet, its artistic value has special meaning. In a manual carpet-weaving where geometric, rectilinear shapes on the big areas are used, the deflection on symmetry is traced very well; however, it is extremely difficult to achieve complete symmetry of a carpet. To some extent, it is connected with carpet-weaver&rsquo;s experience and handwriting, technique of compacting by the group of women weaving one carpet. Each carpet, even when it has a set of the same decorative patterns, will have the distinctive feature determined by manual skills. Symmetry, approximate to 100 percent, is an advantage which is inherent in machine-made carpets. Therefore, at a choice of hand-knotted fine wool carpets, the artistic content stands in the first place, without paying attention to unobtrusive flaws. Traditions and technology of Turkmen carpet-weaving are characterized by beauty and durability. We create our carpets following the restored ancient technologies and it is a fully ecological process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>	\N	Read more

Ковры, энергетика которых уходит вглубь тысячелетий. Это не просто ручной труд, это - искусство, которое требует больших знаний, усилий, труда, интуиции, а главное генетической памяти людей, которые создают наши ковры.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Это - искусство на всех этапах создания. Исследователь туркменских ковров, А.Фелькерзам писал: Кому хоть раз пришлось видеть старинные туркменские ковры, тот никогда не спутает их с изделиями других племен и народов уже по одному орнаменту, не говоря о технике. О технике исполнения старинных туркменских ковров пишет искусствовед, специалист по истории ковроделия Е.Г. Царева: Туркмены являются, по всей видимости, единственным ковродельческим народом, использующим не только разные типы узлов: симметричные, асимметричные открытые влево и вправо, с депрессией и без депрессии, но и особые приемы вязки. В своих коврах мы используем технические особенности в приемах узловязания, характерные для раннего туркменского ковроделия. Незаменимым сырьем для изготовления туркменских ковров ручной работы является шерсть сараджинской породы овец, которая разводится только в климатических условиях Туркменистана и имеет крайне ограниченный ареал распространения.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Сараджинская порода овец - созданная туркменским народом, обладает лучшим качеством шерсти, лишена мертвого волоса и с большим содержанием длинного пуха. Имеет неповторимый мерцающий блеск и шелковистость, что является отличительной и неповторимой особенностью туркменских ковров. Для создания наших ковров мы отбираем лучшую шерсть весенней стрижки. Промывается шерсть вручную только в самые жаркие летние месяцы для того чтобы при сушке на солнце она стала воздушной и сверкающей. После просушивания ее прочесывают на специальном гребне (дарак). Во время прочесывания идет отбор шерсти для основы и для пряжи. Для утка мы используем шерсть ягнят. Затем за дело берутся прядильщицы. Самуи́л Марты́нович Ду́дин русский этнограф, стоявший у истоков Этнографического музея в Санкт-Петербурге писал: Пряжа изготовлялась возможно тщательнее с целью придать ей одинаковую скрученность и толщину на всем протяжении, и в этом отношении туркменками достигались результаты, почти не уступающие машинной выработке. Каждая прядильщица,&nbsp; вручную, в день прядет не более 200-250 грамм, когда на небольшой ковер требуется около 12 кг. После получения нитей начинается процесс окрашивания, который может растягиваться&nbsp; до 5-6 месяцев, в зависимости от желаемого цвета. В старину туркменские женщины большое внимание уделяли ферментации шерсти, которая обеспечивала проникновение протравы внутрь волокна. Ферментация позволяет&nbsp; добиваться стойкой и равномерной окраски, также усиливает эффект свечения нити. После полоскания нитей в проточной воде горных ручьев, нити окрашиваются. В качестве протравы использовались квасцы.&nbsp; Для растительного окрашивания и для закрепления окраски мы используем растения,&nbsp; произрастающие в песках Каракумы, и в предгорьях Копетдага. Надо сказать, что все растения,&nbsp; которые мы используем в окрашивании являются и лекарственными средствами. Нити подготовлены, мы подбираем нити для основы ковра. Учитывается толщина нити, степень крутки, при обязательном условии,&nbsp; что нити для основы должны быть спрядены одной прядильщицей, так как у каждой прядильщицы своя определенная степень крутки и степень натяжения. После того, как нити для тканья и для основы готовы, начинается подбор показателей для нити, которая должна стать утком и это очень ответственный момент. Ковры из чистой шерсти подвержены деформации и требуют бережного отношения.&nbsp; С.М. Дудин писал о лучших образцах туркменских ковров: Они и были теми изделиями, которые всячески сохраняли, берегли, не пускали в повседневный домашний обиход, а показывали на свет только в особо важных, исключительных случаях (приезд гостей, праздники и т.п.). Сегодня с утком из чистой шерсти практически никто не работает, так как известно, что форма чистошерстяных ковров не всегда идеальна. Практически все производители используют основу для ковра и уток с добавлением химического волокна или специальный клей, который применяется с тыльной стороны ковра для фиксации формы. В наших коврах не используются химические компоненты. В коврах ручной работы, как и во всех изделиях которые относятся к народному творчеству, особое значение имеет эстетическое содержание ковра, его художественная ценность. В ручном&nbsp; ковроткачестве, где используются геометрические, прямолинейные формы на больших площадях, очень хорошо прослеживается отклонение по симметрии и в то же время чрезвычайно сложно добиться полной симметрии ковра. Это некоторым образом связано с опытом и почерком ковровщицы, техникой уплотнения ковра группой женщин ткущих один ковёр. У каждого ковра даже при наборе одних и тех же орнаментов, будет своя отличительная особенность, связанная с ручным трудом. Близкая,&nbsp; к 100 процентам симметрия достоинство, которое присуще машинному ковроткачеству. Поэтому при выборе ковров ручной работы из чистой шерсти на первый план выходит художественное содержание, без привлечения внимания на малозаметные погрешности. В традициях и технологии ковроткачества туркмен заложена красота и долговечность. Мы создаем свои ковры по восстановленным технологиям древности и это чисто экологический процесс.</p>	\N	Читать дальше
